2018-01-02,27857.9,Austria sets 2018 FIT for PV systems up to 200 kW,"Owners of residential solar PV systems in Austria will receive €0.0791 per kWh for power surplus in 2018.

The Austrian government announced in late December that PV systems up to 200 kW installed under the FIT scheme will be entitled to receive a tariff of €0.0791 per kWh in 2018. It added that the FIT will drop to €0.0767 per kWh in 2019.

Overall, OeMAG, which is privately owned and entrusted with the public service obligation of buying all renewable electricity and selling it, has allocated around €8 million for the 2018 FIT program."
2018-01-02,27857.9,4NEW Limited: KWATT Coin - Tokenized Electricity,"- 2017 has been a record breaking, awe inspiring rollercoaster ride for cryptocurrency valuations with over 2000% valuation increases. With all the hype and global attention on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, Initial Coin Offerings have attempted to tokenize just about everything in 2017. However, in this culture of tokenization, what everybody has failed to observe is that, with price spikes in crypto valuations comes energy spikes in transactions processing. 
As of September 30, 2017, 1 Bitcoin transaction could power 7.5 homes in the US for a day.  
As of December 31, 2017, 1 Bitcoin transaction could power 10.5 homes in the US for a day.  

 
This trend should cause severe alarm and provide us all with reason for concern. Furthermore, with a tidal wave of ICOs forthcoming this year all intending to take advantage of the hype and frenzy that is frothing within our community, the consumption of electricity to process all these transactions is only expected to rise exponentially. 
A proof-of-work (POW) system (or protocol, or function) is an economic measure to deter denial of service attacks and other service abuses such as spam on a network by requiring some work from the service requester, usually meaning processing time by a computer. 
On the contrary, Proof of Stake (PoS) concept states that a person can mine or validate block transactions according to how many coins he or she holds. This means that the more Bitcoin or altcoin owned by a miner, the more mining power he or she has. 
While we all look forward to proof of stake to evolve, nevertheless, the most sought after, pioneer proven currency remains Bitcoin, which continues to operate on a proof of work methodology. This is why the network is voraciously consuming electricity for the foreseeable future. 
This situation is extremely reminiscent of the heated debate experienced between our dependence on fossil fuel consumption versus our shift to renewable energy consumption as a civilization. This debate has been ongoing for over two decades now, and our dependence on fossil fuels is anticipated to continue for the foreseeable future similar to our dependence on proof of work. 
In lieu of this culminating impending crisis, one company has taken measures to solve this head on. 4NEW Limited, a UK based Waste to Energy treatment plant, launched its pre-sale in the fall of 2017. 4NEW successfully raised USD 30.5MM from US private equity funds in a conventional round of funding, achieving their soft cap requirement. Now with the funding for the plant secured, 4NEW has allocated all its electricity output into its coin, namely KWATT. The plant has a capacity of generating 300 million kilowatts per annum. With a total coin supply of 300 million, each KWATT Coin will be backed by 1 kilowatt of electricity. 
This electricity will be applied towards the mining of bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies. So while our blockchain network protocols take time to evolve into a more energy efficient network, we can have a sustainable mechanism via which cryptocurrencies can transact in an environmentally responsible fashion with zero impact to the climate as is the case with dependence on fossil fuel generated electricity. 
Furthermore, for the first time, we have a utility company solely dedicated to providing energy to blockchain networks; With the people holding the power to allocate this energy in their desired location via a voting structure only available to the KWATT coin holders. Needless to say, 4NEW has successfully tokenized electricity, the most sought after commodity for our civilization with applications not just within the crypto community but also mainstream utilization.

2018-01-04,27187.325,UMass scientists boost polymer-chain storage efficiency,"A team from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst (UMass) have developed a polymer based energy storage system, which releases energy on demand as heat. The scientists say that their system utilizes a polymer chain 'organized like a string of Christmas lights' and can achieve more than double the storage density of previous polymer based systems.

A new battery being developed by scientists at UMass could provide an alternative to lithium storage. The battery stores energy in chemical bonds, releasing it as heat rather than electricity.

According to research published in the journal Scientific Reports, the system developed was able to achieve an average storage density of 510 joules/gram, and a maximum of 690, compared with previous polymeric storage systems, whose density was in the range of 200 joules/gram.

2018-01-04,27187.325,"New DEA CEO: ""Adapt and Adjust""","- Maria Moraeus Hanssen announces a time for change on her first day as CEO and Chairman of the Board of Management of DEA Deutsche Erdoel AG.   
""I am starting at DEA in a very interesting time for the company and for the business as a whole. My main task going forward will be to make sure that we continue to operate safely and deliver on business goals while we adapt to new conditions, in parallel with the talks between LetterOne and BASF to merge DEA and Wintershall,"" says Maria Moraeus Hanssen. 
     (Photo:  ) 
Moraeus Hanssen joins DEA at a time where both the company and the oil and gas industry are facing significant changes. The changing energy markets are leading to structural changes, and early in December DEA's owners LetterOne and BASF signed a Letter of Intent to merge DEA and Wintershall, creating a stronger Germany-based independent oil and gas company. Discussions towards a final agreement are ongoing. She underlines that the most important task for DEA is to continue running its production and projects in a way that creates value.

 
DEA's new CEO expresses her pride of being part of the oil and gas industry, but acknowledges that the industry faces changes: ""DEA's most important asset is the competency of our employees, that will be of great importance also in a merged company. Over the years, DEA's employees have shown an impressive ability to get the most out of the asset portfolio. By continuing and further developing these efforts, DEA will be able to adapt to a world with a more diversified energy market."" 
Moraeus Hanssen: ""It is not immoral to explore, develop and produce oil and gas. It is  many years, oil and gas will still be a prerequisite for keeping the society going. Oil and gas companies' biggest challenge is still not declining demand, but how to find more oil and gas to compensate for the natural decline from existing fields."" 
""We need to explore, develop and produce at lower costs, increased efficiency and with less impact on climate and environment. The oil and gas industry needs to take an active role in the ongoing energy transition. Digitalization and increased focus on technology throughout the business will be some of the levers to help us on this way,"" she says. 
Before joining DEA, Maria Moraeus Hanssen had been working as CEO of ENGIE EP International and Head of EP Business Unit in the ENGIE Group in Paris for the last two years. She looks back to a broad spectrum of jobs in management and operations in the Norwegian Oil and gas industry such as Investment Director, Aker ASA (2008 - 2013), Senior Vice President Gas Supply and Infrastructure, Statoil ASA (2007 - 2008), Vice President / Offshore Installation Manager, Hydro ASA (2006 - 2007) to name but a few. 
Moraeus Hanssen graduated in 'Petroleum Economics and Management' from IFP School - Ecole Nationale Supérieure du Pétrole et des Moteurs, Paris, in 1992 and holds a degree in 'Petroleum Engineering' from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, in 1989. 
Moraeus Hanssen is also the Deputy Chairman, and the leader of the Audit Committee, of the Supervisory Board of Yara International, a global leader in nitrogen-based fertilizer production.

2018-01-04,27187.325,From the US editor: Renewable energy and information pollution,"A recent article in Bloomberg View illustrates clearly the mythology and misinformation that abounds regarding renewable energy, which in many cases is spread by the media.

After covering solar and other forms of renewable energy on a daily basis for nearly eight years, I have come to a deep appreciation of the work done by research institutions, including the United States government's network of national laboratories, as well as the many fine analysts working in various private firms and non-governmental organizations.

Through the collected work of so many and the actual experience of nations such as Denmark, Germany, Spain as well as individual U.S. states, we have come to learn a great deal about the integration of large amounts of solar, wind and other forms of renewable energy on grids, what the challenges are, and what we can expect in the future.

However, I am consistently disappointed that this information is not better represented in the press, including in some energy publications. In many cases, journalists and editors have chosen mythology over careful study and the flash of contrarian viewpoints - even if these are poorly supported or come from sources with a track record of misleading the public - over more credible assessments.

Most recently, I was greatly disappointed by Bloomberg View Columnist Tyler Cowen's op-ed which allegedly reviews Varun Sivaram's latest book but instead appears to be a collection of his own biases and preconceptions applied to a field of which he shows little understanding.

Since the article contained so many unsupported, misleading and inaccurate statements, I'm going to take them one by one.

Claim: ""There is now a doctrine of what I call ""solar triumphalism': the price of panels has been falling exponentially, the technology makes good practical sense, and only a few further nudges are needed for solar to become a major energy source. Unfortunately, this view seems to be wrong.""

Problem: While it depends on what you call ""major"", solar supplied around 2% of the electricity in the United States in 2017 (we are still awaiting final data), as well as more than 10% in California, Nevada and Hawaii in the first nine months of the year. As solar capacities have been doubling roughly every two years, you can expect much more in the future.

Claim: ""Solar energy could be a boon to mankind and the environment, but it's going to need a lot more support, and entrepreneurial and policy dynamism.""

Problem: Varan Sivaram does make such a claim in his work but, from what we have read, for significantly different reasons than the ones that Mr. Cowen references. Instead, Sivaram has addressed the problem of raising the trillions in capital that a full-scale global energy transition requires.

Claim: ""The first disquieting sign is that solar companies are spending only about 1% of their revenue on research and development, well below average for a potentially major industry. You might think that's because things are going so great, but some major solar users ..."

For those not intimately involved with energy policy, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is an obscure agency. FERC regulates interstate energy matters including electricity transmission and oil and gas pipelines, and has been more prominent in the media in recent months due to the Trump Administration's efforts to force an broad coal and nuclear bailout through the agency.

FERC also supplies data on the electricity sector, and the agency's latest Energy Infrastructure Update for November shows that developers have proposed 1,913 new solar PV projects to be put online through December 2020, for a total of 43.5 GW.

This is the third-largest capacity of any generation source, following 92.5 GW of natural gas plants which have been proposed and 72.5 GW of wind. Of course how many of these projects will actually get built is beyond the scope of the report."

 Urban populations are growing: according to the United Nations, roughly two-thirds of the global population will live in conurbations by 2050. In 2014, this figure was just one-half. Urbanization is increasing, and with it the challenges cities have to solve. Even today, therefore, there is a considerable need for smart solutions. Speaking at CES in Las Vegas, the Bosch management board member Stefan Hartung said: ""We need a new conception of the city. One key factor here is technologies that make cities smart and worth living in. In the long run, cities without intelligence will not survive, but succumb to gridlock.""



 Bosch is working to equip cities and neighborhoods for the future, offering smart mobility, better air quality, more convenience, greater security, and many new services. In short, the aim is significantly better quality of life in cities and neighborhoods. ""When it comes to smart cities, few other companies can match Bosch's comprehensive portfolio, cross-domain knowledge, and outstanding expertise in sensors, software, and services - and all this from a single source,"" Hartung said. From January 9 to 12, the supplier of technology and services will be presenting many new solutions that make cities smart at CES 2018, the world's largest electronics show. These range from a new compact unit that measures and analyzes air quality in real time, to a system that digitally monitors river water levels and gives early warning of flood risks, to a completely automatic parking space service that makes drivers' lives easier.



 For more business: the smart-city market is booming 



 Some of the world's major metropolises are already synonymous with the term ""smart,"" among them Barcelona, Seoul, and London. Across the globe, cities large and small are investing in smart-city technologies. According to a study on behalf of Bosch, the smart-city market will grow 19 percent each year between now and 2020, reaching a volume of 800 billion dollars (680 billion euros). Bosch believes this is a great business opportunity: ""For a long time, the smart city was a vision. We're helping make it reality. Bosch is in an excellent position to make the connected city a technological and commercial success,"" Hartung said. The company is currently involved in 14 extensive smart-city projects in places such as San Francisco, Singapore, Tianjin, Berlin, and Stuttgart. Others are planned to follow. Within the past two years, the company has doubled its sales from cross-domain projects to nearly one billion euros, and this figure is set to rise further.



 In the Bay Area city of San Leandro, for example, the company has equipped roughly 5,000 streetlights with LEDs and supplied a system for remote management of the city's street lighting. In this way, the lights are only switched on when they are actually needed. With this solution, San Leandro will be able to save roughly 8 million dollars over the next 15 years. At the Bosch CES press conference, Mike Mansuetti, the president of Bosch North America, said: ""Whether cities are big or small, our smart solutions will help them save energy, and money too."" In the case of San Leandro and its 100,000 inhabitants, sensors can be used to measure and analyze air quality, and cameras can automatically re-route traffic in the event of congestion.



 For more connectivity: IoT and artificial intelligence 



 The internet of things (IoT) has laid one of the main foundations for the connected city. The IoT is finding its way into all walks of life: a Gartner study predicts that some 230 million homes worldwide - roughly 15 percent of all homes - will be intelligently connected by 2020. Here as well, the potential is huge, with market volume estimated to reach 250 billion dollars annually by 2020. By the same year, more than 20 billion devices worldwide will be connected with each other - smoke detectors, burglar alarms, electricity meters, home appliances, and many more. ""Bosch recognized this potential early on,"" Hartung said. ""Even now, more than half our electronic product classes are web-enabled - and the aim is for this to be 100 percent by 2020. Not only that: for each of our products, we want to offer accompanying services.""



 Another driver of the rapid development of smart cities is artificial intelligence (AI). Bosch intends to further expand its research in this field. Last year, the company opened a research center for artificial intelligence, which now employs some 100 associates in Renningen, Germany, Palo Alto, CA, and Bengaluru, India. By 2021, Bosch will invest some 300 million euros in expanding the center. The company anticipates that, ten years from now, scarcely any product will be conceivable without AI.



 For better air quality: Climo creates basis for targeted action 



 Air quality is one of the greatest challenges cities face. Thanks to smart technologies, cities can take faster and more targeted action to improve it. However, this depends on accurate measurements. At CES 2018, Bosch is presenting a new solution that it developed together with Intel - the Climo microclimate monitoring system. Climo measures and analyzes 12 parameters that are important for air quality, including carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, temperature, and relative humidity. The appliance is one-hundredth the size of conventional systems - and one-tenth the cost. Climo won a CES Honoree Innovation Award in the ""smart cities"" category.



 For early warning: digital monitoring of rivers 



 In many regions, climate change is resulting in unpredictable weather. Researchers expect that heavier rainfall will result in more frequent flash flooding. Up to now, mechanical devices have been used to measure river water levels. Hours may pass before these measurements become available for others. However, the flood monitoring system changes all this. In real time, it monitors the water level in rivers and other bodies of water close to cities, and warns of an impending flood. In a pilot project, Bosch is testing the new system on the Neckar river near Ludwigsburg, Germany. Ultrasonic sensor probes and cameras track changes in water level, speed, and throughput. The data is sent to the Bosch IoT Cloud for processing. Should critical thresholds be exceeded, the affected municipalities, residents, and business owners are alerted well in advance by text message. This gives them enough time to take precautions against flooding and flood-related damage. Among those interested in the solution are a number of Indian and South American municipalities that frequently have to combat flooding.



 For more time: connected parking 



 Urban traffic will increase by roughly one-third by 2050. Bosch is working to make tomorrow's mobility free of accidents, stress, and emissions. At CES 2018, the company is presenting many solutions that lead toward this goal. Urban traffic plays a role in roughly half the smart-city projects Bosch is involved in. Parking is a particular focal point. U.S. drivers now spend more than 40 hours a year stuck in congestion, wasting some 160 billion dollars in the process. Of this time, roughly one-third is wasted on the search for parking alone. This is where Bosch can help: with its community-based parking, the company simplifies the search for a suitable space. As they drive by, cars automatically recognize and measure the size of the gaps between parked cars, transmitting the data in real time to a digital map. In this way, drivers can have themselves guided directly to free parking spaces. Bosch is already testing this service in German cities, including Stuttgart. This year, as many as 20 U.S. cities will follow, including Los Angeles, Miami, and Boston.



 In early 2018, moreover, Bosch and Daimler will be launching a new automated valet parking service. Cars in the Mercedes-Benz Museum parking garage in Stuttgart will look for a parking space and park themselves, without a driver. This cuts out stress, and makes more efficient use of parking lots - the same amount of space can accommodate up to 20 percent more vehicles. One factor making fully automated parking a reality is smart parking-garage infrastructure, which connects with the vehicle's on-board software. Bosch recently won a Frost & Sullivan's 2017 Technology Innovation Award for this driverless parking solution.



 For energy and cost savings: Bosch DC microgrids 



 According to the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), cities account for roughly 75 percent of total global energy consumption. Forty percent of this is attributable to buildings alone. And the BP Energy Outlook 2035 estimates that global energy consumption will rise 30 percent by 2035. Bosch has many smart energy management solutions that can reduce power consumption. One of these is the Bosch DC (direct current) microgrid, which can be used to supply power to large buildings or building complexes. Since microgrids are generally fed by renewable sources, they are especially eco-friendly. DC microgrids consume up to 10 percent less energy than conventional power plants. Another major advantage is their self-sufficiency, which makes them a reliable source of power when a weather- or security-related outage affects the broader grid.

On the solar front, the country accounts for 60% of all cell production; and will continue to lead installation developments for at least the next five years. New 2020 targets are expected to be set. In the battery arena, Chinese companies are also set to dominate.

China's global dominance in the clean energy industry has been highlighted in a new report, China 2017 Review: World's Second-Biggest Economy Continues to Drive Global Trends in Energy Investment, published by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).

IEEFA finds that China ruled supreme in both the building and financing of clean energy technology in 2017.

A key development in the country's leading role was U.S. President Trump's decision to back out of the Paris Climate Agreement, a move, the report's authors say, that led to China's ""quick reaffirmation"" of its emissions-reduction pledge and in installing renewables capacity in new markets.

""The clean energy market is growing at a rapid pace and China is setting itself up as a global technology leader while the U.S. government looks the other way,"" says Tim Buckley, co-author of the report and IEEFA's director of energy finance studies.

He adds, ""Although China isn't necessarily intending to fill the climate leadership void left by the U.S. withdrawal from Paris, it will certainly be very comfortable providing technology leadership and financial capacity so as to dominate fast-growing sectors such as solar energy, electric vehicles and batteries.""

2018-01-16,27834.749999999993,Seasonal patterns show a need for more solar in the U.S. electricity mix,"An abundance of hydroelectric power and wind is pushing up renewable energy in the spring months, but there is a need for more power during the summer peak, as well as issues with the geographic location of resources.

Germany has been a global leader in many aspects of the transition to renewable energy, including both deployment policies and strategies for grid integration. One aspect of the nation's Energiewende (Energy Turn or Transition) that is often underestimated is the deployment of complementary volumes of wind and solar, so that the overall amount of renewable energy has been relatively stable on a seasonal basis for many years - although the dismantling of policy support for solar may have pushed the balance in the direction of excess wind in 2017.

By contrast, the United States is seeing more of an unplanned, free-market transition to renewables, driven by a combination of tax policies, largely resource-agnostic renewable energy mandates, and raw economics. And as an analysis from the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA) shows, this led to a seasonal imbalance in the aggregate output of renewable energy sources in 2017.

2017 saw particularly high levels of hydro output, due to a very wet winter in Western States. This peaked during the late Spring with the nation's hydroelectric dams generating more than 30 terawatt-hours (TWh) in May alone, and falling to around half that level by October.

However, wind also displayed a seasonal pattern, with a national aggregate output of around 25 TWh each month in March and April, falling to only 15 TWh in August. By contrast solar peaked in June at around 6 TWh. The net result was that total U.S. renewable output peaked in March, April and May and fell to its lowest level during August.

ABB has won an order worth more than $40 million from a consortium comprising Doosan Heavy Industries and state-owned construction company PT Hutama Karya, to upgrade and expand the Muara Tawar combined cycle power plant in West Java, Indonesia. The innovative project will add 650 megawatts (MW) of electricity to the national grid. The order was booked in the fourth quarter of 2017.

In order to improve the efficiency of the plant and provide clean energy to the greater Jakarta area, the current 1,150 MW gas-fueled generator will be converted to a 1,800 MW combined-cycle power plant.

The combined-cycle power plant uses both gas and steam turbines to produce more electricity from the same fuel than a traditional simple-cycle plant. The waste heat from the gas turbine is routed to the nearby steam turbine, which generates extra power. The power plant is operated by Indonesia's national power utility PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN).

Indonesia is the world's fourth most-populous country and one of the fastest growing economies in Asia. This has spurred the need for electricity, and according to PLN, demand is projected to grow at around 8.5 percent per annum between 2015 and 2025. In response, the government has outlined a plan to add 35,000 megawatts (MW) of new power generation capacity between 2015-2019.

Indonesia aims to have 99.7 percent of households in the country connected to the nation's electricity grid by 2025, which would require an additional power generation capacity of over 80 gigawatts (GW). The country is also targeting 23 percent renewables in its energy mix by 2025. The Muara Tawar upgrade and conversion to a combined cycle power plant will contribute significantly to these goals.

""ABB has a long-standing presence, expanding footprint and proven track record in Indonesia and we are pleased to contribute further to the development of the country's power infrastructure to serve the country's growing economy and vibrant population,"" said Claudio Facchin, President of ABB's Power Grids division. ""We are proud to be a part of this innovative project which supports our vision of enabling a stronger, smarter and greener grid.""

As part of the turnkey project, ABB is responsible for the design, engineering, installation and commissioning of supporting components and auxiliary systems of the plant. ABB will also supply a 500 kilovolt (kV) air Insulated Switchgear (AIS) substation. Key product supplies include generator circuit breakers, medium- and low-voltage switchgear as well as transformers and protection equipment.

ABB recently inaugurated a new manufacturing facility for high-voltage switchgear in Tangerang, on the outskirts of Jakarta. This is part of ABB's continued footprint expansion in the country including the establishment of a new factory for medium-voltage products in 2015 at the same location.

Roughly 6,100 complaints were lodged against Deutsche Post with the Federal Network Agency in 2017 over the service. The agency also confirmed that its own inspections showed that the service provided by Deutsche Post had “deteriorated significantly.”

“Over half of the complaints were to do with the processing and delivery of letters and packages,” the Saarbrücker Zeitung reports.

The Federal Network Agency confirmed the figures to the German Press Agency (DPA).

The Federal Network Agency, which is the oversight authority for electricity, gas, telecommunications, post and rail services, criticized the fact that only slightly over half of post boxes were emptied in the early morning.

At the same time, Deutsche Post employees increasingly no longer work on Sundays and public holidays.

“This is one of the reasons why people have the feeling that post isn't delivered on a Monday anymore,” the Federal Network Agency stated.

At the beginning of December, the Federal Network Agency had already reported increased complaints, but at that time their increase for the year as a whole was estimated to be only a quarter to 5,000.

But the number of complaints rose sharply in the Christmas season, which was particularly labour-intensive for Deutsche Post. Most complaints concerned delayed delivery of letters and parcels or them being put into the wrong mailboxes.

A spokeswoman for Deutsche Post said the company takes every complaint seriously. She pointed out that 94 percent of letters and 90 percent of parcels reach the recipient on the next working day.

She added that ""the increase in complaints is also due to the fact that the Federal Network Agency is increasingly perceived by the public as a complaints body for concerns in the postal sector"".

2018-01-22,22314.350000000002,Japan: Disappointing first auction; plans for 200 GW solar by 2050,"Japan's first solar PV auction has reaped disappointing results, with just 41 MW set to be developed. Under the revised FIT, meanwhile, 27.7 GW were cancelled. Despite this, JPEA is aiming for 200 GW of solar PV installs by 2050. Overall, cumulative installed capacity has reached over 40 GW. There are still many plans afoot for large-scale projects, although it is the rooftop sector, which holds the most promise.

In its JPEA Outlook 2050, the Japan Photovoltaic Energy Association (JPEA) has said it is targeting 200 GW of solar PV installs in Japan by 2050. According to Japan's RTS Corporation, as of October 31, 2017, over 40 GW across roughly 240,000 PV systems have been installed under the FIT, introduced in 2012.

Last year, around 7 GW were installed. In an interview for the February edition, RTS' Izumi Kaizuka told pv magazine that utility scale installs represented around 3 GW, while residential comprised 1 GW and non-residential, 3 GW. Next year, a further 6 to 7.5 GW are expected. Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) forecasts this to reach 63 GW by 2019.

Despite the high tariffs and impressive installation rates - particularly given Japan's geographical limitations - the solar industry continues to suffer from high prices, being one of the most expensive countries to generate solar electricity. In an attempt to ease this, the Ministry of Economy, Trade & Industry (METI) announced in 2016, that it would switch to a reverse auction mechanism to stimulate growth.

Commenting on what the auction means for growth and prices, Martin Tengler, Japan solar analyst at BNEF told pv magazine, ""The auction will slow down the 2MW+ solar market. It may lead to an increased interest in More auctions

A further two auctions are planned for this year, in May and September, with a total of 500 MW potentially available. However, depending on how the first auction is subscribed, the second will be adjusted to reflect this figure.

Until then, the government is working with industry to amend the requirements needed to participate in the auctions. In the December issue of its monthly PV Activity in Japan and Global PV Highlights newsletter, RTS said, ""The ceiling price will be set, but it will not be announced and will be disclosed after bid opening. As for the forfeiture of the secondary deposit, the scheme will be reviewed based on the result of hearings to industrial organizations, in order to reduce the risks … [for] project developers.""

In addition to an auction system, METI also introduced a new FIT Act in April 2017, which saw tariffs fall to between JPY21 and 30/kWh, depending on system size. According to RTS, approvals for 456,000 projects totaling 27.7 GW were cancelled following its enactment.

  It was back in November, on Armistice Day in France, the day on which the end of World War I is celebrated, when Vésuve de Brekka trotted up the Champs-Élysées in a steady rain with French President Emmanuel Macron. Not quite two months later, he then accompanied Macron to Beijing, where the nine-year-old gelding ended up in a paddock in a Beijing suburb -- quarantined in conformance with the regulations.

  
	



	


The horse was the gift Macron brought along for his first state visit to China. At the banquet held in his honor, Macron presented Chinese President Xi Jinping with a photograph of the beautiful animal taken in the stalls belonging to the Republican Guard in France.

  
The anecdote provides a perfect illustration of the young president's foreign policy. Macron isn't afraid of doing the unexpected and he is often impetuous. More than anything, though, every move he makes on the international stage exudes self-confidence -- and has since his very first day in office. His overly long and excessively firm handshake with Donald Trump before practically suffocating him in cordiality during U.S. president's Bastille Day visit to Paris. His cordial golf-cart tour through the gardens at the Palace of Versailles with Russian President Vladimir Putin before blasting Russian propaganda at the subsequent joint press conference. His adoption of the role as chief climate protector along with the motto: Make Our Planet Great Again.

  Although he is new to the world of international politics, he wants everyone to take notice. He exploded onto the stage at the beginning of his term -- and it is a principle that he continues to adhere to. He seems to be everywhere at all times, while smaller, carefully dosed gestures are few and far between. Macron has a weakness for grand gestures and pomp, the product of his love of symbolism.

  
	


He isn't afraid of physical contact either. He hugs, he pats, he beams. He clutched Trump's arm during the Bastille Day parade and threw his arm around Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's waist during the latter's recent visit to the Élysée Palace. 

  And his guests don't seem to be put off by it. Donald Trump called Macron a ""great guy"" who is ""smart"" and ""strong."" Even German Chancellor Angela Merkel, hardly known for her lyricism, quoted Hermann Hesse after her first meeting with Macron after his election, saying: ""A magic dwells in each beginning."" Chancellery Chief of Staff Peter Altmaier has gushed that Macron reminds him of the French poet Rimbaud.

  
Extremely Direct


  Since last May, the world has once again been taking notice of France and seems not to be able to get enough of this boyish-looking French leader and the grandeur he surrounds himself with. Within just a few months, Macron has managed to accomplish something his predecessors had been unable to do for decades: Make France look modern again, as a leading European country with a growing sphere of influence. The president has a conspicuous talent for finding the correct tone to reach whoever he is talking to, say his staff. That, they add, gives him the latitude to be extremely direct.

  
	


It was not all that long ago that France was seen as a country tightly bound in a corset of sclerotic structures, slowly strangling itself to death. It only landed in the headlines when it was struck by yet another terrorist attack -- or when yet another member of the political class tried to shrug off yet another weighty scandal. Lethargy characterized French domestic policy while its role overseas was anemic at best.

  It is an image that those who came before Macron were unable to change despite embarking on numerous foreign military interventions. Nicolas Sarkozy sought to raise his international profile by intervening in the Libyan conflict while François Hollande bombed Islamic State positions in Iraq and Syria. Both were ""terrible mistakes,"" Macron now says. France's new president prefers dialogue, saying ""we'll talk with everybody"" -- and he has even sought to establish contact with the Syrian dictator Bashar Assad. Macron also intends to be the first top French politician to visit Iran since 1971. And he wants everything to happen as soon and as fast as possible. 

  Yet despite his seeming impulsiveness, he has received international admiration. ""In Macron, France may have found its third transformative president"" like Charles de Gaulle and François Mitterrand, the magazine Foreign Affairs wrote in December. In November, the American newsmagazine Time wrote of the French president: ""Although he says he's not seeking to become the leader of the free world, he can sound like he is."" The British magazine Economist, meanwhile, chose France as its country of the year. ""In 2017, France defied all expectations,"" the magazine wrote. France is back.

  
An Equal Partner


  In Brussels, long-serving French diplomats suddenly find themselves astonished at the amount of weight their president's words can carry. And in Berlin, it has become clear that German leaders view France as having returned as an equal partner. Evidence can be found in the fact that many of Macron's ideas for bringing Europe closer together, elucidated in a speech delivered at the Sorbonne just after the German election, have found their way into the preliminary coalition agreement recently cobbled together between conservatives and Social Democrats in Berlin. Last Friday, Merkel even flew to Paris to personally update Macron on the progress she has made in finally assembling a government.

  Relations with Germany were important to Macron from the very beginning of his tenure. Indeed, that is one reason why he appointed the former French ambassador to Germany, Philippe Étienne, as his chief diplomatic adviser. A friendly 62-year-old with extensive experience in the world of diplomacy, Étienne speaks fluent German, Russian, Serbo-Croatian and Romanian. He also graduated from the École nationale d'administration together with François Hollande. Macron's foreign policy team is made up of 12 advisers, some of them classmates with whom the French president went to university while others worked with him back when Macron was economy minister under Hollande. One of those is Clément Beaune, 35, whose presentations on Europe even when he was still in school were so accomplished that they were widely shared. Beaune remained loyal to Macron throughout the campaign and the French president's proposals for European Union reform were clearly influenced by his adviser. Beaune is humorous, clever and straightforward - a rather rare character trait among diplomats.

  In China, Macron landed a diplomatic coup with the gift he brought along, with President Xi Jinping apparently being quite touched by the gesture. Xi had been gushing about the horses in the Republican Guard ever since a visit to Paris in 2014.

  Macron promised to visit China every year, saying: ""France is and will continue to be the power at the heart of Europe that will lead the dialogue with China,"" seemingly forgetting that the job has largely fallen to Merkel in recent years. No matter, though. It was the gesture that counted. After all, the sentence is a quote from Charles de Gaulle, who has been highly esteemed in China ever since France became one of the first countries in the world to recognize the People's Republic in 1964. 

  The visit to China, wrote an Italian newspaper, made Macron the clear leader of Europe. Germany's business daily Handelsblatt promoted him to the position of Europe's chief diplomat.

  Macron, of course, is also trying to use his own radiance to benefit France. He has said openly that his country should once again take on a central role in international affairs. ""L'influence,"" France's traditional aim of having a say on the global stage, remains a priority in the Élysée. And even if Macron is younger than his predecessors have been, he has echoed them by insisting he will do all he can to ensure that French soon replaces English as the global lingua franca. But why?

  
Lack of a Sparring Partner


  Attempting to keep an eye on Europe's interests at the same time won't be easy. Particularly when it comes to countries like China. After all, one important focus of such trips is the closing of multi-billion-euro trade deals.

  One reason for Macron's currently high profile in the world of international diplomacy, of course, is that he doesn't have much in the way of competition. Trump's volatility holds sway in the United States, the British are cloistering themselves from the outside world and Merkel has very clearly passed the zenith of her powers. In the Western hemisphere, at least, there doesn't appear to be anybody standing in his way. Some, though, believe the lack of a sparring partner could ultimately prove problematic. What, after all, can a single person accomplish on his own?

  Bertrand Badie, a professor for international relations at prestigious Sciences Po university, thinks that Macron is too peripatetic. Diplomacy, Badie says, is actually an exercise best performed quietly and discreetly. Successful diplomatic initiatives, he says, are seldom accompanied by a brass band.

  ""Why does he want to be part of negotiations everywhere, get involved everywhere?"" Badie asks. What can the ultimate benefits be of seeking to assuage Trump and keeping Iran on a tight leash while trying to solve the conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians at the same time? Macron, Badie says, has thus far produced little more than images -- though, he allows, it is far too early to pass judgment on Macron's foreign policy. Nevertheless, the professor says, it is a typically ""French deformation"" to want to be involved everywhere at the same time.

  And it is true that Macron has his finger in a number of pies at the moment. He has received Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, followed a short time later by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, all while facilitating the return of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri from Saudi Arabia. Last summer, he retreated to a castle outside of Paris to negotiate a cease-fire for Libya. But the primary effect of these ""peace talks"" was that Macron, who emphasizes the importance of multilateralism at every opportunity, managed to seriously irritate some. 

  

	
  Then, at the end of last year, he seemed intent on outdoing even himself. Within just one week, he spent three days traveling through West Africa before continuing on to Algeria and Qatar. He organized his own climate summit, to which he didn't just invite heads of government and state, but also the international charity elite. The project, which has generated plenty of headlines if, thus far, little else, has been christened the One Planet Summit. Just one day later, he hosted a meeting of the group known as the G5 Sahel to discuss joint targets in the fight against terrorism in Africa.

  
A New Relationship of Equals


  Though it is occasionally overdone, the importance of symbolism in foreign policy shouldn't be underestimated. Macron's ambitions could end up having far-reaching consequences, particularly for Europe. His proposals for reforming the EU have been met primarily with deep skepticism in many Eastern European countries, with a government minister from Slovakia even comparing Macron's plans for Europe to climbing Mt. Everest without an oxygen mask. Many other EU member states, however, have reacted positively to Macron's ideas.

  The fact that Macron represents a new generation of politicians became clear during his trip through Africa. During a stop in Burkina Faso, which was a French colony until 1960, Macron held a speech before a rather skeptical audience in the capital of Ouagadougou -- and he adopted a highly unusual tone. During the extensive question-and-answer session that followed, a university student asked aggressively how Macron expected people to successfully complete their degrees when the air conditioning was constantly failing due to the poor electrical power supply in the country. The French president listened attentively before delivering a clear answer: ""You speak to me like I'm a colonial power, but I don't want to look after electricity in Burkina Faso. That's the job of your president."" 

  The comment earned him a fair amount of criticism, but Macron is not ignoring history. Rather, he hopes to stand for a new relationship of equals. His message is: Let's leave the past behind us and focus on the future.

  
	


It is an outlook that has proven popular among the French. Even as his approval ratings plummeted last summer, he has recovered nicely since then. Despite his unpopular reforms to his country's social system, French voters are pleased with the figure Macron has cut on the international stage, with fully 75 percent saying they approve of the way he represents France overseas.

  It is the kind of approval rating that neither François Hollande nor Nicolas Sarkozy even came close to during their five years at the helm in France."

BILD met him for an interview.BILD: Prime Minister Skvernelis, the German company Continental pledged to build a factory here in Lithuania the next summer. It is the largest-ever German investment in Lithuania that will create more than one thousand jobs. How important is this investment for you and how far can it help in tackling Lithuania's emigration problem?Saulius Skvernelis: ""It is highly important for us to have foreign direct investments. Not only because we want to ensure economic growth, but also because we want to curb the emigration flow from our country. Germany is the third most important EU country in terms of foreign investments and recently we have been pleased to see industrial investment money coming to Lithuania, and here Continental is quite worthy of mention. Until recently, we had service-related investments, but these investments are quite mobile and can be transferred further-on. This is why Continental's automotive electronics plant is so important for Lithuania's economy and we highly appreciate the German investment. Let me use this opportunity to invite all German investors to come to Lithuania. Our government is ready to provide individual support packages for investors.""

         BILD: It is not only German investors that are coming to Lithuania. You already have here almost 600 German troops as part of NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence initiative. While many in the West see these troops as a stabilisation factor, Russia described them many times as a ""provocation"". How would you describe the German contingent in your country?Skvernelis: (taking a deep breath) ""Talking about security in our country, I would like to mention several aspects. Again, foreign direct investments by big economies contain also a regional dimension. When we talk about security, the decision by NATO to deploy Enhanced Forward Presence troops was a very important decision and Germany is a leading country in this mission in Lithuania. We believe this to be a truly stabilising factor. I am particularly pleased about this and this is why I personally visited German soldiers in Rukla. Germany as a leading NATO country clearly ensures security and stabilisation for our country. This is by no means a provocation, but a response to possible provocations from the other side. And by the way: 80 percent of the Lithuanian population support this deployment.""
					BILD: Talking about provocations. In September last year, Russia conducted its large ""Zapad"" exercise, virtually almost all along your borders. Russia says this was an anti-terror exercise, but the Estonian chief-of-staff, for example, believes it was directed at the Baltic states and NATO. What is your knowledge about this particular  of similar nature have been periodically organised, so this was not the first time that it was held at our borders. But according to the information we have, for the first time the exercise was not based on a defensive scenario but had an offensive character, including eventual use of nuclear weapons. So this was clearly not an anti-terror exercise. While the Belarusian side was cooperative and transparent, we missed that transparency from the Russian side.""

					BILD: Let us come back to the economy. A very important economic endeavour for Germany and Russia in the Baltic space is Nord Stream 2. Germany wants this pipeline, Russia wants it, but almost no other country with a Baltic coastline wants it. What is your position on this controversial matter? Skvernelis: ""We see Nord Stream 2 as a political project rather than an economic one. Its main goal is to ship Russian gas to western European countries by bypassing Ukraine. By doing this, Russia is trying to distort competition and to erode the economic footing of other countries. The project is hence harmful for the targets of the Energy Union. Also, this project would increase dependency from a single supplier. We should develop projects which diversify the sources to meet our energy needs instead of limiting us to one supplier and one route. Lithuania knows very well what it means to be dependent on a single gas supplier, namely Gazprom. As soon as we established alternative sources of supply (the Klaipėda LNG terminal), we could function normally again.”
BILD: You are talking about the ""LNG"" liquid gas terminal in Klaipeda? How important is this project for you?Skvernelis: ""This project is highly important for us. I am not questioning the price we paid in implementing this project. However, we provide gas supply to Latvia and Estonia even though we did not manage to  reach an agreement among the Baltic States to make Klaipeda a regional gas supply centre for the Baltic States. If we had managed to make the LNG terminal in Klaipeda a regional project, we could have used financial support from the European Union, leading to a decrease in the gas prices for the whole region.""BILD: Are you still trying to extend the gas network to your neighbours in the north...Skvernelis: ""Yes, indeed. We are still working towards this and we are still seeking a common regional gas market. Because there is an underground gas storage facility in Latvia and Estonia also has a small gas terminal. If we had agreed on the project before and attracted European Union support, we could have decreased the gas prices for the consumers of the Baltic States by seven percent. This could have also contributed to the competitiveness of our region.""BILD: You have been quite critical towards the Nord Stream 2, Zapad and other Russian projects in the region. Still, you mentioned only a few weeks ago that you are planning to re-establish better relations with Russia and re-activate the Russia-Lithuania intergovernmental commission after seven years. Do you think it is time for your country to approach Putin's Russia?Skvernelis: ""It is very simple. We should act in a similar way as many other European Union member states, like Germany or Finland, do. At the same time, we are strictly adhering to our key values and agreed positions. We are not questioning the sanctions or the position towards Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. Nor are we changing our position as regards Russia being obligated to adhere to international law and its commitments, including on human rights.However, there are certain interests shared by both our citizens and our businesses. At the same time, we are ready to openly present our views and concerns related to Russia’s policies that have implications for regional and international security. I am not speaking about highest-level political contacts, but about contacts at the political level like the intergovernmental commission that you have mentioned. Its reactivation could help us to understand the positions of the other side.""

This topic is highly sensitive for Lithuania and sometimes my words are misinterpreted.""BILD: The last question is about the Astravets nuclear plant in Belarus, which we could see from here if the weather was better today. The previous government labelled its completion next year as a ""threat to Lithuania's national security"". What is your government's take on it?Skvernelis: ""I had many meetings with the Heads of States of various EU member states, including the Chancellor of Germany as well as the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker and in all these meetings, I conveyed the message that the nuclear power plant in Astravets was being constructed in disregard of all international nuclear safety standards and other international legal standards. Our position is very clear: This is not a problem between Lithuania and Belarus, but a problem to be tackled between the European Commission and Belarus. It does not have anything to do with efforts to enhance bilateral economic cooperation. Unfortunately, my government has inherited this problem and now, practically, the nuclear power plant has already been built and is almost operational. So we could not have done anything else other than passing a legal act prohibiting the import of electricity produced in unsafe nuclear power plants in third countries. If, at the time when this nuclear power plant was only planned, the Lithuanian government had spoken to the Belarusian side and not supported this project passively, then we could have had entirely different results. But these steps should have been taken already in 2008, 2009 and 2010. At that time, the then-government should have made every effort to prevent this nuclear power plant, which has now been completed just 40 km from Vilnius. I believe this could have been prevented back then if appropriate negotiation measures had been taken.BILD: So you are talking about the government some nine years ago. But what can you do now to address this threat to your nation?Skvernelis: ""Of course, we have to make every effort to stop this plant from becoming operational. It is important that the European leaders and the European Commission understand that this nuclear power plant has been constructed in violation of all international standards and, if it is so, its operation has to be prevented, and we have to do – and are doing – everything to achieve this goal!"""
2018-01-25,19675.099999999995,"Train derails near Milan, three dead (4) - English","(ANSA) - Milan, January 25 - A train derailed near Milan on Thursday, leaving three women dead and five injured people in a serious condition, the Milan prefect's department said. Another eight injured people are being treated as code yellow for the emergency room and 33 are code green. Railway company RFI has found a 20-centimetre section of track that broke away some 2km from the derailment and this may have been the cause of the disaster, according to experts. It is possible that the wheels of three wagons came off the tracks there, but the coaches continued to move with the rest of the train until hitting an electricity pylon, sparking the crash at 6:57 at Seggiano di Pioltello.

    The Trenord train, which had 350 people aboard, mostly commuters, departed from Cremona and was heading towards Milan's Piazza Garibaldi station.

    Two of the victims were named as Pierangela Tadini, a 51-year-old originally from Caravaggio but resident in Vanzago in the province of Milan; and Giuseppina Pirri, 39, from Cernusco sul Naviglio. The authorities are still working to identify the third victim, also a woman.

2018-01-25,19675.099999999995,Financing of PV projects in Iran remains challenging,"Interview: Iran intends to build new PV and wind power plants totaling 5 GW in the coming years. The first PPAs were already signed. Germany's Geon secured a FIT contract for a 120 MW solar park. The company's managing director Sharam Roghani explains why this is only half the battle and why financing projects in Iran remains difficult. He has not found a lender yet, and time is running out.

pv magazine: Mr, Roghani, can you briefly describe what Iran is doing to promote solar?

Sharam Roghani: In the coming years, Iran aims to increase the generation capacity of renewable energies - primarily wind power and PV - to 5 GW. For this purpose, a legal framework and a dedicated authority were created. The head of the authority reports directly to the Minister of Energy. This shows how Iran is taking this matter seriously. The legal framework provides for a fixed feed-in tariff for the renewable electricity supplied over 20 years, with a reduction to the tariff after 10 years. There are a lot of other details, all of which are agreed in the PPAs between the Department of Energy and investors.

Has this policy driven new growth in 2017?

First of all, I want to point out that the Iranian calendar is different from the western one. By the end of 2017, Iran had signed PPAs for wind and solar with a combined capacity of 2.2 GW. According to the competent authority SATBA, about 1.2 GW of wind turbines and 1.0 GW of solar plants may result from these contracts. So far, wind farms totaling 89 MW and 63 MW of photovoltaic systems have been connected to the grid in the country, according to data published by SABTA.

Your company has also secured a PPA for a large-scale solar park. Can you provide more details?

After four years we managed to secure a PPA for a 120 megawatt project. To my knowledge, it is currently the largest photovoltaic project with a signed PPA in Iran. The most time consuming business for us, was to secure land for the project.

What is included in the contract?

The contract has a volume of about 100 pages. In addition to important parts such as lease, grid connection, nature conservation permit and planning permission, additional technical information on the project and the legal and economic agreements are listed.

How much time do you have for the project's construction?

2018-01-26,21089.825,Locomore's bumpy ride,"It was the David to Deutsche Bahn’s Goliath: a vintage train that could get you from Berlin to Stuttgart for €22 with free wi-fi and organic food. But it went bankrupt in less than half a year. Now, Locomore has been resurrected. But who’s behind the wheel?

As the 14:28 departs Lichtenberg, a voice rolls over the tannoy welcoming everyone onboard Wagen 1819. The passenger carriage is a Bmz Interregio number from the 1980s, with vintage feel still intact and a garish, Wes Anderson-esque orange-and-red interior. Kids play around with the wooden train set in the Familienabteil (family section) as their parents connect to the onboard wi-fi. At the bistro, a friendly employee proffers organic, vegan snacks and €2.30 fair-trade coffee, while posters in the hall proclaim this train is running on 100 percent renewable energy. If all goes well, Wagen 1819 will pull into Stuttgart in seven hours, hitting 13 stops along the way including Hanover and Frankfurt. The price? Under €40.

This feels like what German entrepreneur Derek Ladewig had in mind when he started Locomore, his long-in-the-making crowdfunded “green alternative” to Deutsche Bahn, in December 2016. But this isn’t his train. In fact, it’s run by Czech rail company Leo Express in conjunction with bus giant Flixbus. Ladewig is still on board as a manager, but the open-access operator (the term for a train company that purchases individual slots on a railway system, instead of franchising like the national companies) he founded just a year ago is no more.

Deutsche Bahn controls over 99 percent of long-distance rail travel in Germany; since the country’s rail system was liberalised in 1994, barely any companies have tried to disrupt that monopoly. Because rail infrastructure costs are so high (the Infrastrukturnutzungsentgelte, or “track access charge”, is around €5-7 per kilometre), it’s difficult for smaller companies to turn a profit, especially when long-distance buses are so inexpensive to run. The country’s first private rail company, Interconnex, was started by the Transdev corporation in 2002 and ran between Leipzig, Berlin and Rostock for 12 years, but folded in 2014 after failing to rival bus prices. Another, the Vogtland-Express between Berlin and Plauen, ran between 2005 and 2012 before being replaced by a bus fleet.

Ladewig, a former political scientist and transit consultant to the Bundestag, thought he had the answer when he founded Locomore GmbH in 2007: stick to one route, and choose it wisely. After initially being part of the founding team of the Hamburg-Cologne Express (HKX), an open-access train line between the two western cities that finally launched in 2012, he decided to focus on the Berlin-Stuttgart route exclusively. After applying for permission to use the tracks and receiving approval, his company signed the contract with DB Netz, Deutsche Bahn’s subsidiary in charge of managing infrastructure. The eight carriages, refurbished in Bucharest, were rented to Locomore by leasing company SRI Rail Invest GmbH.

After raising over €460,000 in crowdfunding on Startnext, Locomore hit the rails at the end of 2016. But despite transporting 70,000 passengers in five months, the earned revenue didn’t hit Locomore’s targets. The crowdfunding capital dried up. Shortly after launching, Locomore’s original schedule of seven weekly roundtrips between Berlin and Stuttgart was cut down to just four, to address “infancy problems”. It didn’t help. Ladewig’s company filed for bankruptcy in May 2017.

Today, Locomore seeks loftier heights. It relaunched last August after lengthy sales negotiations, mixing the railway muscle of Leo Express with the ticket sales expertise of Flixbus. The red-and-orange trains now ferry 420 passengers between Berlin and Stuttgart five days a week, Thursday through Monday. Customers who participated in Locomore’s crowdfunding campaign can still use the vouchers they received for the new service, and even a few employees remain from the early days – one of whom, a crew member named Christian, says his job feels “very much the same as before”. Ladewig is now employed by Leo Express, and insists that the Czech company and Flixbus field all press questions.

“We don’t consider ourselves as rivals to Deutsche Bahn,” Flixbus spokesperson Martin Mangiapia says of their sales takeover. “We both have the same goals: reducing car traffic and increasing mobility.” Leo Express already had their eye on the German rails, and Flixbus can now add another train to its ‘intermodal concept’, which already includes pairings with private rail company Westbahn in Austria, ferry partners GNV in Italy, and Scandlines in Scandinavia.

Not everything is the same since the takeover. For one, those posters telling you “You’re riding with renewable energy” aren’t exactly telling the truth. Mangiapia explains that since Leo’s takeover, Locomore cut off the deal with Dusseldorf’s Naturstrom AG, and are now running on regular electricity again. According to their fact sheet, Flixbus’ big vision is “smart and green mobility for everyone to experience the world”, and Ladewig’s original goal was minimising pollution by taking people out of their cars; you feel a little cheated to say the least. Both Leo and Flixbus’ spokespeople make it clear that, of course, they would prefer renewable energy, but the question is when will it happen? “This could be a topic for the future, but it’s been pushed back as we wanted to take care of the smooth running of the trains first,” says a speculative Mangiapia. “But we’re planning to switch back soon...” In the meantime, those misleading Ökostrom posters need to be pulled down sharpish.

Actually booking your trip is another issue: despite Flixbus’ huge online marketing presence and user-friendly app, there’s no way to search only for Locomore trips. Unless you already know the route, you’ll be trawling through lists of bus times for hours. “People look for a connection, not a means of transportation,” Mangiapia says, but this doesn’t make sense for a company looking to boost passenger numbers. The lack of Locomore branding anywhere online shows that they have a long way to go. Flixbus’ focus is so geared to their buses that their new train service feels like an afterthought. The same goes for the Hamburg-Cologne-Express, which stopped running in October until Flixbus swooped in to take over sales duties last Christmas.

It’s a long way to go for Locomore, and it’s one mean feat to square up to a company that can easily run 40,000 trains per day, but they’ve got some things right. The toilets are immaculate (almost on par with the spaceship-feel gleam of the ICE), and there are two separate bike storage zones, no reserved seats, and no class divides. Passengers also seem content with moving at slower speeds (200kph) for a cheaper ticket. Short-distance prices start at €5, long-distance from €9.90. Booking around three weeks in advance, the same route with Deutsche Bahn would set you back €79.90 for a Sparpreis ticket (5.4 hours travel time), in comparison to Locomore’s €39 (7.02 hours). A bargain, as long as you’re not travelling with kids. Unlike Deutsche Bahn, Locomore doesn’t provide children under 15 with a free ride.

But for the company’s young, trendy target demographic, the extra hour and a half of travel time is worth the savings – point proven by the 70,000 tickets sold since the relaunch. Not bad for a four-and-a-half month stint for a two-trip-a-day train."

In the years 2015 and 2016 the bank financed some EUR 15 billion in investments in the expansion of renewable energy with promotional loans totalling EUR 10 billion. This is the finding of a study conducted by the Centre for Solar Energy and Hydrogen Research Baden-Württemberg (ZSW). The significance of KfW's programmes for the electricity sector is particularly noteworthy. The bank financed around 47% of new generating capacity from renewables that was installed in Germany in the years 2015 and 2016. A particularly high share of onshore wind energy was financed by KfW (56%).



 ""KfW's promotional programmes make an important contribution to climate action. They also have a positive impact on the labour market and reduce Germany's dependence on energy imports"", said Dr Jörg Zeuner, Chief Economist of KfW Group.



 In the past years major progress has been made in expanding the use of renewable energy in the electricity sector. A high need for catching up remains in the areas of heating and transport.



 ""Much of the climate-friendly conversion of energy supply in these two sectors, however, will have to be based on electricity generated from renewables. The expansion of renewable energy in the electricity sector will therefore have to be continued systematically along with building refurbishment"", demanded Dr Jörg Zeuner.



 Other key findings of the study:



 - The renewable energy systems financed by KfW in Germany in 2015/16 reduce greenhouse gas emissions permanently by a total of 9.5 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year. A further 0.3 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year was avoided by systems financed abroad over the same period.



 - The reductions in greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions brought about by the projects financed in Germany can prevent an estimated EUR 960 million in damage caused primarily by climate change on a global scale each year.



 - The energy systems financed in the years 2015/2016 allowed Germany to avoid energy imports worth a total of around EUR 550 million each year. Across the expected 20-year lifetime of the system, this will amount to some EUR 11 billion in savings.



 - The manufacture and construction of the systems financed and installed in 2015 and 2016 (excluding offshore wind energy) secured or newly created around 89,000 jobs in Germany for a year. Another 2,700 jobs were added each year for system operation and maintenance.

The aim is for EON to focus on the retail, energy networks and customer solutions business, while RWE would take over the renewables power generation of both companies.

RWE plans to sell its 76.8 percent stake in Innogy to EON in a deal that includes ""a far-reaching exchange of assets and participations"", said EON, which also plans a cash offer to the remaining Innogy shareholders.

RWE would, in turn, gain an effective participation of 16.67 percent in EON. EON would also transfer to RWE most of its renewables business and the minority interests held by its subsidiary PreussenElektra in two RWE-operated nuclear power plants.

RWE would receive the Innogy renewables and gas storage business and Innogy's stakes in the Austrian energy supplier Kelag.

2018-03-13,25646.374999999996,"Energy giant EON to cut 5,000 jobs as part of huge takeover deal","In a joint statement, EON and RWE said they planned to complete their asset swap transaction, which surprised investors when it was unveiled this weekend, ""by the end of 2019"".

EON said it expects the Innogy takeover to generate some 600 to 800 million euros in savings annually from 2022, but warned that the ""integration process"" will lead to ""a reduction of a maximum of 5,000 jobs"" out of a total of around 70,000 jobs.

""At the same time, EON anticipates to create thousands of new jobs in the coming decade,"" the statement added.

The ultimate goal of the transaction is to allow EON to focus on retail customers and on managing energy networks, essentially buying and selling electricity, while RWE will specialise in generating power from fossil fuels and renewables.

The complicated arrangement comes amid huge upheaval in the sector as Europe's top economy switches from conventional to renewable power under the government's so-called ""Energiewende"" or ""energy transition"".

The deal would first see EON acquire RWE's 76.8 percent stake in Innogy, valuing the clean-energy spin-off at some 22 billion euros.

Pending the green light from financial regulators, EON then intends to make a voluntary takeover offer to Innogy's minority shareholders from ""early May"", offering 40 euros per share.

RWE for its part would gain an effective participation of 16.67 percent in EON - turning the one-time competitor into EON's largest shareholder.

The next step of the deal would see RWE take control of EON's renewables business, including Innogy's renewables, its gas storage business, its stake in Austrian energy supplier Kelaq and EON's minority stakes in two nuclear power plants.

In return, RWE will make a cash payment of 1.5 billion euros to EON.

Innogy's energy networks and customer base would remain with EON.

The transaction is still subject to regulatory approval.

The deal would make RWE ""a leading European electricity producer,"" according to the statement, as the firm becomes Europe's third-largest renewables producer while also hanging on to gas and coal-fired power plants to ensure ""security of supply"" despite their harmful impact on the environment.

EON meanwhile said it would ""focus entirely on meeting the demands of its around 50 million customers across Europe"", and pledged to look into novel climate protection solutions -- such as the faster roll-out of charging stations for electric cars.

Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed the companies' manoeuvres earlier Monday, saying she was ""confident"" both EON and RWE were working to find ""the best ways"" to assure ""the supply of sustainable energy"" and respond to the country's energy shift.

Germany's energy market has been rapidly transformed since Merkel announced a phase-out of nuclear power after Japan's 2011 Fukushima disaster.

Under the ""energy transition"", Germany has raised the share of solar, wind and other renewables to about one third of electricity production.

As wholesale power prices have dropped, the big utilities have been forced into major restructuring.

In response to those challenges, EON spun off its fossil fuel operations and invested heavily in renewables, while RWE remains the biggest power producer and still operates major coal-fired plants.

In a separate statement Monday, EON unveiled its 2017 financial results, which showed adjusted net profits jumping 58 percent year-on-year to 1.4 billion euros.

Operating, or underlying, profit came in at 3.1 billion euros, while EON was also able to trim its massive debt from 19.7 billion last October to 19.2 billion euros.

2018-03-16,27452.699999999997,"Monitors at Berlin airport to be replaced for €500,000 before ever being used","They never announced a single arrival or departure, nor did they ever inform a single passenger of a delay or a gate change. The 750 monitors at BER airport remained blank for six years. Nonetheless, they have now reached the end of their lives due to the fact that they were constantly connected to the airport's electricity circuitry.

BER spokesman Hannes Stefan Hönemann confirmed on Thursday that the screens have been burned out by six years of being pumped full of electricity. He confirmed that the monitors would be replaced at a cost of €500,000.

The first major challenge involved in moving in Germany is of course finding the next place you will call home. Particularly in the big cities, this can be very difficult, as living space is becoming an ever more precious resource.

There are various internet sites that advertise rental apartments. But these don't always offer the best value for money. With a little patience and luck, you can find something much more reasonable.

If you know that you will be staying in Germany for several years, it is worth becoming a member of a Genossenschaft (co-operative). Rents are much lower than market rates with a Genossenschaft and the profits made from rents go back into the upkeep of the building, meaning your apartment will be in good nick. The downside is that there are often waiting lists involved - it is worth remembering that waiting times will be much shorter in less fashionable parts of town.

Another potential way of staying in the realms of affordability is by swapping your old apartment with someone else. Many people might come to a point in their life when it makes sense to upsize or downsize. If you are already on a cheap contract, but a new family member is about to take up a bit more space in your flat, you are in a good bargaining position. Check out the site homeswapping.de to research your options.

If you need a place quickly though, you might end up having to work through internet sites such as immobilienscout24 and immowelt. If you do so, it is advisable to become a member of a Mieterverein. These organizations are there to help you know your rights as a tenant. They will look at your contract before you sign it and be able to advise you on whether the rent is in breach of the rental brake law and what options you have to force a change.

Finding a place that is right for you

It goes without saying that the more money you are prepared to spend, the more picky you can be about your apartment.

Altbau apartments, which date back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, are all the rage. So if you get your hands on one you are sure to be the envy of many of your friends. The attraction of these flats is that they often have beautiful wooden floors (Dielenboden) and high ceilings, giving the impression of more space than the square-metre size suggests.

But Altbau Wohnungen aren’t without their faults. The floors can be creaky and the windows let in the cold. If you are sensitive to sound, you might be driven mad by the vibrations being sent down into your living room by neighbours padding around upstairs.

Altbau apartments are also much less likely than Neubauten (new builds) to have balconies. Neubauten will usually be better insulated and thus kinder on your wallet - and they are often much cheaper than an Altbau. So if it is location you are after, you may well find that there is less competition for a Neubau in fashionable neighbourhoods, even though it is offered at a lower rent.

When you are flat hunting, think about what is more important to you, daylight or peace and quiet. You can strike lucky and get both. But if you live in a Vorderhaus (front house) you are more likely to get sun, whereas living in a Hinterhof (rear house) protects you from the noisy street, but also often means less direct light. If you really value sunlight, you should also look for a south-facing apartment on one of the top floors.

Moving house in any country can be a costly business, but in Germany there are certain peculiarities which add to overall costs.

Number one among these oddities is the general fact that the tenant is expected to bring their own kitchen. While this might make sense for Germans, who often rent a place for several years or more, it is less than ideal for the more transient expat population.

Younger people who do not want to hire a removal company might find themselves with some hard choices in front of them: do they take their washing machine and fridge with them, meaning lugging heavy appliances up and down several flights of stairs? Or do they try and sell them to their Nachmieter (tenant who takes over the contract) and then buy new appliances that would be delivered?

This is not a simple financial decision to make. Luckily your Nachmieter is often in the same position as you, they also don’t want to heave a washing machine up five flights of stairs - so they are likely to be amenable to a deal.

Buying kitchen appliances new can cost an arm and a leg. So it is certainly recommendable to have a look at shops that refurbish old models - you could save several hundred euros and the reliable shops will also offer you a year-long warranty. On the downside, older machines will eat up more electricity, meaning higher bills. Ultimately, if you are only planning to stay for a year or two, buying a second hand machine seems advisable.

It is also a good idea to start looking for a kitchen before you move in. If you are lucky you might find a knock-down offer of a complete set of kitchen cupboards on Ebay Kleinanzeige, a website on which people flog things they don’t want anymore.

How you choose to move your stuff will depend on how much of it you have and how many friends you can convince that a bottle of beer is fair reward for almost putting their back out.

It is certainly worth considering hiring a van and doing it yourself, rather than getting an expensive removal company to do this. Germans have this down to an art form - if you walk through Berlin on a Saturday morning it becomes a sea of blue and white - the colours of the van hire firm Robben und Wientjes.

While hiring a removal company is likely to cost you upwards of €200, renting out a van can cost as little as €35. If neither you nor your friends have a driver's license, several drivers offer their services affordably (often with help carrying boxes to boot) on Ebay Kleinanzeige.

Don't expect great customer service from Robben and Wientjes though. It is also important to bring along your Anmeldungsbescheinigung when you pick up your vehicle. And take a picture of the odometer before you start and when you hand in the vehicle (you might end up with an unwanted bill otherwise.)

Setting up a new internet connection for your apartment can be a real pain in the rear. You will often have to wait several weeks before the provider sends around a technician to activate your connection. Don't be surprised if the technician arrives before your router has shown up, or if they just don't turn up at all.

There are also various deals offered online by the companies Vodafone and Telekom, the major two providers. But the ones that look cheap often have hidden costs in the second 12 months of the contract. Therefore it is a good idea to keep in mind when the contract should be cancelled.

Switching electricity providers can also be a pain. In some contracts you have to give notice of cancellation 12 weeks in advance. And providers generally do not allow you to change the name on the contract, meaning it is often impossible to pass the bill onto the person who is taking over your room or house from you.

Default energy provider Vattenfall, however, allows you to register your name and expected monthly energy usage tier on their website once the old tenant has cancelled their service.

Registering your new address is of course a real nuisance, but it is much worse in big cities than in smaller towns. Strictly you have to register within two weeks of moving in, but authorities often turn a blind eye to infringements - in Berlin it is not unheard of for people to get away with failing to register for several months.

A useful shortcut to know is that you can halve the work by flipping a coin with your housemate or partner. The lucky one can sign a Vollmacht which gives the other permission to register for them. You can find a template for a Vollmacht on the internet. Remember though, to fill out your Anmeldungsformular first. That can also be found online. And if you are registering two people, you need to make two consecutive appointments.

Because Germans are addicted to sending things by post you should prepare yourself for a significant amount of paper correspondence after you move. Your new Finanzamt may well pester you with questions about your religion. And if you want to avoid a €20 fine from your bank, send them a physical letter stating your change of address.

If you take on your own apartment in Germany, you need to know a bit of basic DIY. And if you don't have a tool box it is very useful to have a friend who does.

When you move in, your new apartment will often just be white walls and a ceiling with some wires poking out of it. At some stage within the first few days after moving in, you will find yourself gingerly balancing on top of a ladder, trying to attach a light to the ceiling.

And for everything from fastening a wall cupboard to your kitchen wall to putting up a curtain pole, you will need to know how to use a drill and spirit level.

It is also important to know where you are allowed to drill. Generally it is okay to make holes in walls, which can be filled in again when you move out. But drilling into wooden door frames is a no-no.

If you come from a country where apartments are usually furnished with the basics when you move in, you are well advised to collar a German friend into helping. Believe us, they are much better trained at this kind of thing than we are!"

2018-03-27,23444.524999999998,Frankfurters told to get on bikes as public transport grinds to halt,"Things started to get complicated for commuters in Frankfurt on Monday when Deutsche Bahn closed down the train tunnel in the inner city to lay a new electricity cable, the Frankfurter Rundschau reports.

Seven of the city’s nine S-Bahn lines have been affected by the closure, which is to last until April 9th.

Despite the fact that Deutsche Bahn announced the closure months in advance, public service union Ver.di have decided to throw fuel on the fire of the crippled transport machinery by striking on the city’s tram and U-Bahn lines on Wednesday.

Ver.di, which is calling for a six percent pay increase for public workers nationwide, said Tuesday that it would stick to the decision taken on Friday to strike for the whole day.

When Ver.di called strikes in Cologne last week, the S-Bahn proved to be a vital alternative source of transport for commuters desperate to get to work.

The S-Bahn is managed by Deutsche Bahn, whose workers negotiate pay deals with the state-owned company through their own train unions and are thus not involved in the current pay dispute.

That leaves commuters with the possibility of travelling on overcrowded buses, or on the few S-Bahn lines that have not been affected by the tunnel closure.

Frankfurter Rundschau has another alternative for commuters - rental bikes. There are a total of 2,700 bikes parked at 300 stations across the financial hub."

Some 85 kilometres of the 1,225-kilometre pipeline from the Narva Bay on Russia's border with Estonia to Lubmin in northeastern Germany will run through German territory.

Along with a previously issued approval from the mining authority based in Chancellor Angela Merkel's coastal Stralsund constituency, the permit lifts the final hurdle to construction on the German side.

Approvals are still needed from Russian, Finnish, Danish and Swedish authorities.

Nord Stream 2 AG, the company behind the pipeline and a subsidiary of Russian state-controlled energy firm Gazprom, said it was ""pleased"" with the result and hoped to secure the outstanding permits ""in the coming months"".

The pipeline project remains controversial in Germany as well as European Union neighbours like Poland and Baltic states Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, who fear it could be used as a tool to boost Russian influence over the bloc.

Moscow notoriously used gas prices to pressurise Ukraine during a mounting conflict with its former satellite which saw Russia annex the Crimean peninsula in 2014 -- prompting EU sanctions in response.

Meanwhile, a rare cross-party alliance of high-ranking German politicians from Merkel's Christian Democratic Union, the environmentalist Greens and pro-business Free Democrats last month warned against allowing Nord Stream 2 to go ahead.

It would ""split the EU politically and call into question our solidarity with Poland, our Baltic neighbours, Slovakia and Ukraine, but also Sweden and Denmark,"" they wrote in a letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper.

And the European Commission said last year it sees ""no need"" for Nord Stream 2 as it pursues energy security and diversity of gas supply across the 28-member bloc.

Merkel has said she believes Nord Stream 2 is a purely ""economic project"" with no need for political intervention."

ABB has won an order worth more than $90 million from Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA), the leading power utility in United Arab Emirates (UAE), to build the Shams 400 kV substation that will integrate solar power from upcoming phases of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum solar park into the city's electrical grid. This will be ABB's second substation for the park, exemplifying the company's commitment to deliver reliable power to consumers and serve the building and infrastructure sector alongside utility and industry customers.

Following years of rapid growth and urbanization, Dubai continues to be one of the fastest-growing cities in the world, and booming growth in population and economic sectors, like tourism, have increased demand for energy. To increase power supply and meet goals for increased use of renewables, the UAE launched its ambitious Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050 to make Dubai a global center of clean energy and green economy.

The Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum solar park, located inland 50 km south of Dubai, has been a central part of Dubai's renewable strategy. When completed in 2030, the park will occupy 214 square km, generate 5,000 MW and reduce carbon emissions by approximately 6.5 million tons.

ABB is responsible for the design, supply, and installation and commissioning of the Shams 400/ 132 kV substation, which once completed, will have an overall capacity of more than 2,000 megavolt amperes (MVA). When Phase-3 of the project is finished in 2020, which is the same year that Dubai will host Expo 2020, the total solar power generated through Solar Photovoltaic will exceed 1,000 MW, and significantly lower carbon emissions.

""We are proud to work with DEWA and continue to contribute to this landmark project with our state-of-the-art technologies that will boost capacity and bring cleaner solar power to the people,"" said Claudio Facchin, President of ABB's Power Grids Division. ""Integrating renewables is a key element of our Next Level strategy and our proven track record reinforces our position as a partner of choice for enabling a stronger, smarter and greener grid.""

Meeting the clean energy objectives requires a capacity of 42,000 MW of clean and renewable energy by 2050. The most prominent project to achieve these objectives, is the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, which will have a generation capacity of 5,000 MW by 2030, with investments totaling AED50 billion. The solar park will contribute to reducing over 6.5 million tons of carbon emissions per year when completed"", said HE Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Managing Director and CEO of DEWA.

The ABB substation includes supply of 400 and 132 kV gas-insulated switchgear, power transformers, protection, automation and control systems as well as surveillance and communication systems. The substation will also be IEC 61850 enabled, to support open and seamless communication with all intelligent devices.

The charter contract entered into by Endesa and Knutsen spans a period of 7 years with two possible extensions for seven and six years respectively, and will guarantee part of the maritime transport needs under the LNG purchase agreements held by both Endesa and the Enel Group (to which Endesa belongs) over the coming years. The value of the contract is some 25 million dollars per year, and the construction cost of the LNG carrier amounts to around 200 million dollars.

Endesa has agreed to purchase 2 bcm (two million cubic meters) of LNG from the Corpus Christi project in the USA, which will begin commercial operation in 2019 precisely, when the construction of the carrier is completed.

This is the first time that Endesa has chosen to time-charter its own LNG carrier, given that up to now it had chosen to contract LNG delivered at destination. After tendering the future LNG carriage services in 2016, this medium-term contract type was selected to cover needs over the next 20 years with flexible, competitive options.

The vessel, sailing under the Spanish flag, is 299 meters long and 48 meters wide with a draught of 26.4 meters. The volume of LNG transported by the LNG vessel is equal to one day’s demand from the whole of Spain or the annual supply for a city of 170,000 households.

Endesa has a diversified energy mix and is present in both the electricity and the gas markets. The company is the second largest gas retailer in Spain, with an overall share of nearly 16.1% of the conventional market."

2018-04-11,30217.775,Washington Governor supports renewable natural gas industry | NGV Journal,"Governor Jay Inslee signed into law a bill designed to result in the increased development and use of renewable natural gas in Washington. The Coalition for Renewable Natural Gas (RNG Coalition) and supportive stakeholders were able to overcome challenges and garner approval for the bill in the final days of a shortened 2018 executive session. Proponents of the bill also include the Northwest Gas Association and regional renewable energy companies Promus Energy and Regenis.

“This bill will help in our fight against climate change by reducing highly-polluting methane emissions and displacing fossil fuels with low-carbon, renewable sources of biogas”, said Gov. Inslee. “As we transition to a clean-energy future, this will help us promote production of renewable natural gas from landfills, wastewater treatment plants, food processing, and agriculture, while also helping create jobs and promote rural economic development across our state.

“By supporting renewable natural gas project development, Washington’s leaders are supporting the creation of clean energy sector jobs, improved air quality and public health,” said Johannes Escudero, CEO of the RNG Coalition. “Methane mitigation, carbon sequestration and decarbonization of our existing natural gas infrastructure occur with each new RNG project.”

The bill will require the Washington State University Extension Energy Program and the Department of Commerce, in consultation with the Utilities and Transportation Commission, to submit recommendations on how to promote the sustainable development of RNG to the Governor and the energy committees of the Legislature by September 1, 2018; require the Department of Commerce, in consultation with natural gas utilities and other state agencies, to explore the development of voluntary gas quality standards for the injection of RNG into the state’s natural gas pipeline system; and reinstate and expand incentives in order to stimulate investment in biogas capture and conditioning, compression, nutrient recovery, and use of RNG for heating, electricity generation and transportation fuel.

Washington is currently home to two of the nation’s approximately 70 operational renewable natural gas facilities. RNG is produced from organic municipal solid waste in the Cedar Hills Landfill, and from wastewater at the King County South Treatment Plant. One additional RNG project is under construction at the Roosevelt Landfill, and two more projects are likely to begin construction in the coming year: one in Tacoma, and one in the Yakima Valley."

2018-04-13,28370.924999999996,Save Berlin: Mute’s Mega-Berlin,"Dan watched the Netflix flop to find out how our city’s future stacks up.

As a film, the recent Netflix thriller Mute is a derivative bore. But for those of us fretting over Berlin’s future, Duncan Jones’ sci-fi vision is a blast. As our city drifts toward neutered mediocrity, the director promises the Berlin of 2052 will be a souped-up version of the seedy 1970s playground inhabited by his dad, David Bowie.

Bowie moved to Schöneberg in 1976, seduced by Weimar Berlin’s 1920s decadence, and produced his signature album, Heroes. While Mute’s hero Leo Beiler (Alexander Skarsgård) searches the Berlin of tomorrow for his missing girlfriend, director Jones goes back and reconstructs the wild and crazy Cold War Berlin he glimpsed visiting his father as a kid.

In Mute’s alternate future, American soldiers still patrol the streets where insults like “commie” and “yankee” are bandied about, and everyone still uses deutschmarks – printed with Angela Merkel’s face. But the Berlin Wall is gone. A car chase through West Berlin ends at the East Berlin restaurant Ständige Vertretung, and Leo picnics next to the Brandenburg Gate, shown wedged between tall buildings. The best part of Jones’ alternate future: Berlin’s tight-assed city planners have learned to relax and love two current no-nos, neon signs and skyscrapers. In 30 years, Mitte will be a forest of glowing towers, like Dubai on the Spree.

The film doesn’t offer cameos by survivors of Bowie’s Berlin like Iggy Pop, Brian Eno or Romy Haag, but it gives screen time to three Cold War landmarks we’re lucky to still have around:

Mute’s hero Leo crosses paths with his nemesis Cactus Bill (Paul Rudd) in a scene filmed at Kottbusser Tor, in today’s Kremanski cafe. It’s a ground level store-front in that sprawling mega-project, the Neues Kreuzberger Zentrum. Opened in 1974, the complex was aimed at upgrading/sanitising a seedy corner of then-West Berlin – with the unspoken goal of scaring away the growing immigrant population. It didn’t work. Today, 70 percent of its 300 flats are occupied by non-Germans. In April 2017, city-owned housing company Gewobag bought the complex, guaranteeing its survival as affordable housing into the 22nd century. But Mute literally takes the building to the next level, showing it doubled in height. Leo is seen traversing the project’s upper-level “street-in-the-sky”, a feature planned but never completed in the 1970s due to budget cuts.

While scouting futuristic Berlin locations, director Jones was psyched to stumble on Charlottenburg’s Internationales Congress Centrum (ICC). He described the late-1970s megastructure to entertainment website IGN: “It looks like a spaceship from Battlestar Galactica that’s just landed in the city... [and] on the inside it looks like a Kubrick set.” In Mute, the ICC’s lobby plays a mid- 21st-century shopping mall. In reality, the asbestos-filled building has been unused since 2014 and was threatened with demolition until Berlin’s Senat kicked in €200 million to save it last year. Its future function isn’t fixed, but they’ve singled out one option not on the table: shopping centre.

The seedy underbelly of Mute’s Berlin is a steamy, multi-level red light district. Signs for a fictional Rudi-Dutschke-Straße S-Bahn station place it blocks from Checkpoint Charlie, but it was actually shot inside a cavernous Cold War-era power plant. The Kraftwerk Mitte on Köpenicker Straße began generating East Berlin’s electricity in 1964. Shuttered in 1997, it’s been revived as a stunning event venue and home to the dance club Tresor.

Director Jones should have waited. Blocks from the real Checkpoint Charlie, a new building’s going up that’s destined to rank among the city’s futuristic megastructures. The Axel Springer Neubau, by Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas, will be a high-tech office block with gaps in its skin revealing a cave-like atrium. Set to open in 2020, it will be daring, quirky and a camera-ready backdrop for Berlin’s real-life sci-fi future."

2018-04-13,28370.924999999996,Acquisition of another wind farm,"Marburg (pta013/13.04.2018/10:30) - * Investment volume of approx. TEUR 830 is fully self-financed

 * Total rated output 6 MW - guaranteed feed-in tariff according to EEG until 12/2020

3U HOLDING AG (ISIN DE0005167902) announces the purchase of an existing wind farm with 6 wind turbines and an installed total rated output of 6 MW. The net purchase price for the targeted acquisition of 100 percent of the company shares is approx. TEUR 830 and thus at a favourable approx. TEUR 140 per MW of nominal output. At present, sales contracts for about 95 % of the shares are already closed. The acquisition of the shares is fully financed by own funds. Effective date of transition is January 1, 2018.

The wind farm Klostermoor in the state of Lower Saxony was built in 1999 and has a guaranteed feed-in tariff according to the EEG up to and including December 2020.

The annual electricity production of the wind farm is expected to average 8,200 MWh to 8,500 MWh; this results in an annual remuneration according to EEG of approx. TEUR 770 to approx. TEUR 800. The amount of sales achieved after the expiry of the guaranteed EEG remuneration cannot yet be reliably predicted today. However, 3U HOLDING AG assumes that the wind farm can continue to operate profitably after the end of the guaranteed EEG remuneration.

As a result of the transaction, 3U HOLDING AG is taking another important strategic step in the segment Renewable Energies towards a successful project manager in the field of wind energy. In the financial year 2017, this segment generated sales of EUR 9.7 million (2016: EUR 4.9 million) and EBITDA of more than EUR 6.2 million (2016: EUR 3.7 million).

Together with the newly acquired wind farm, 3U HOLDING AG generates continuous income from its own electricity generation via existing solar and wind farms with a total nominal output of around 45 MW. In addition, the Company announced in 2017 the successful sale of the wind farm Schlenzer. For 2018, an option agreement has already been agreed for the sale of another wind farm (Lüdersdorf II)."

2018-04-16,26893.6,The transformation of Italy’s supermarket chains,"The retail landscape has changed significantly in recent years due to innovations in e-commerce and consumer spending behavior. Malls in particular, are making way for full-service supermarkets. These supermarkets offer a wide range of products and services, from underwear and organic vinegar, to even car sales. A 

ccording to a study by Cushman  Wakefield, (which revealed that 300 out of 1100 malls will shutter in 2018), American brick-and-mortar retail spaces are experiencing the most disruption.  

 

Curated spaces
 

Attention to detail is key. In Milan, almost every retail space is designed with the purpose of being functional and aesthetically pleasing. Whole Foods (the American organic supermarket chain recently purchased by Amazon) pioneered a look that was “minimalistic” and “curated” — with vegetables and fruit color coordinated — that Italian supermarkets were eager to adopt. 

Carrefour is a good example of this: Not only are many of its stores now open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, but the supermarket also offers free wi-fi and services such as dry cleaning, fax/photocopying, printing photographs, booking cinema and concerts tickets, and in collaboration with Italian Post Offices, paying your gas or electricity bill directly at the cashier. Specific locations even have plumbers, electricians and locksmiths handy. 

 

Italy’s growing supermarket chains 
 

The Carrefour Urban Life in Milan’s Corso Garibaldi has bar and restaurant called Tokyo Street with fresh sushi, a dining area, and a health zone that makes fresh smoothies, salads and homemade ice cream. Upstairs there is a free co-working area (similar to WeWork) with a meeting room (must be booked beforehand and costs at least 8 euros per person) with video projector, microphone, free wifi for everyone. After 7pm the space turns into a lounge that rivals the cutest cafes of Brera — with aperitif cocktails are served until 10 pm. Although the model is only available in Milan at the moment, it will soon be adopted in other cities. 

 

Even supermarket chain Esselunga has expanded their offerings. Their Atlantic Bar is available in almost 90 out of their 157 supermarkets, their perfumery chain (EsserBella) is present in about 35 stores, and some of the larger stores have playpens with staff for young children. At one point, one of their Milan stores even had a matchmaking service.  

 

In Bicocca (a district in Milan), Coop launched the ‘supermarket of the future’: The store is equipped with over 100 touchscreens where you can shop and it will give you all kinds of useful information about the product like how many saturated fats it has). 

 

Even the NaturaSì — Italy’s leading organic supermarket chain — has gone full-service: Their metropolitan stores boast a restaurant and pizzeria, while decentralized shops, like the one on Cascine Orsine, are available farms and on school campuses conscious about students’ nutrition.  

 

Increased automation
 

Fast check out and automatized registers are replacing human employees in many supermarkets. The exception is Tuscos, which recently opened in Monza and is one of the few family-owned full service supermarkets in the business.

How can the growing need for transporting goods coexist with the need to limit the effect of urban traffic on human health? A part of the answer could be trucks with pure electric drive, already announced by some manufacturers.

     (Photo:  )
 
A camera team from INFOkontor took a look around in Gothenburg, where a global truck manufacturer presented the first electric truck in series production. In addition, the project ""ElectriCity"" with a fully electric bus line shows how less noise and fewer emissions can relieve urban life with the use of electric drives.


 
The occasion is the world premiere of Volvo FL Electric, which is already entering regular operation for customers. The start of series production is planned for the beginning of 2019. Volvo Trucks sees itself as a pioneer of this development, not only in the electric motor, but also in truck batteries, load capacity and range.
 
As part of a holistic view to urban life, the new technology will allow road transport at night times, massively reducing the burden on roads and time required for urban logistics.
 
INFOkontors editorial video content features the introduction of the new Volvo FL E-Truck, its current and future applications as well as critical questions of transport.

2018-04-17,22503.100000000002,First zero-emission CNG hybrid agricultural vehicle announced | NGV Journal,"Efficient Drivetrains, Inc. (EDI) announced the integration of its EDI PowerDrive™ 4000 into a Class-4 General Motors Low Cab Forward platform, creating an industry-first truck for agriculture applications. The vehicle combines the benefits of a CNG and Plug-in Hybrid technology and is geared to help agriculture fleets switch from petroleum-based liquid fuels to domestically available, cleaner burning natural gas and electricity.

The zero-emissions vehicle features a unique technology collaboration between Efficient Drivetrains and A-1 Alternative Fuel Systems, integrating the EDI PowerDrive™ Plug-in Hybrid powertrain, and the A-1 CNG Frame-Mount (FM) natural gas system into a General Motors Class-4 work truck commonly utilized by the agriculture industry. The truck will be operated in San Joaquin Valley, a 250-mile-long region susceptible to air pollution due to its bordering mountain ranges.

While in operation in San Joaquin Valley, the new vehicle provides 40+ miles of zero-emissions driving, and range extension utilizing cleaner CNG, resulting in a significant elimination of particulate matter that its traditional diesel counterparts expel. Vehicle operators will experience the expected full power OEM truck performance without change to driver behavior, with the added benefit of zero-emissions driving, cleaner air for their workforce and the surrounding community, and significantly reduced fuel costs.

“Collectively, the agriculture industry in California is working proactively to improve air quality and exposure to particulate pollution from traditional diesel vehicles, and we are proud to contribute to this important initiative. Our technology collaboration with A-1 Alternative Fuel Systems combines the value of electricity with cleaner burning natural gas, delivering a full-powered, zero-emission capable truck, on a vehicle platform commonly utilized by the agriculture industry,” said Joerg Ferchau, CEO of Efficient Drivetrains."

In the spirit of this collaboration, DOE’s Fuel Cell Technologies Office announced that SimpleFuel, winner of the $1 million H2 Refuel H-Prize, is exporting one of the world’s first hydrogen refueling appliances to Japan.

With this first U.S. export of cutting-edge technology innovation to long-time hydrogen collaborator, Japan, the H-Prize showcases how federal prizes can be used to incentivize American entrepreneurs to accelerate technology advancement. The H2 Refuel H-Prize competition successfully challenged America’s innovators to deploy an on-site hydrogen generation system to fuel hydrogen vehicles, which can be used in homes, community centers, small businesses, or similar locations.

SimpleFuel’s home scale refueling appliance can provide a 1-kilogram fill to vehicles in 15 minutes or less at 700 bar using hydrogen produced via electrolysis, with a cost-effective design that minimizes setback distances and reduces the physical footprint of the system. This approach complements the conventional retail fueling stations currently being funded by states and the private sector. SimpleFuel is a collaboration of three companies: IVYS Energy Solutions, McPhy Energy N.A., and PDC Machines.

With support from the Japanese Environmental Ministry of the Central Government, the SimpleFuel appliance will run on solar or grid electricity for use with a Toyota Industries fuel cell forklift truck at the Kesen Precut Cooperative. Kesen Precut manufactures high quality wood and wood chip products for the Japanese market with two production facilities in Sumida Town and Rikuzentakata."

Brexit hit is fading

This is the first time since summer 2015 that Britainâ€™s inflation rate has fallen for two months running.

The inflationary impact of the poundâ€™s slump, after the EU referendum, seems to be fading.

Jeremy Cook, Chief Economist at WorldFirst, explains:





 

â€œCPI is at its lowest in a year and Marchâ€™s decline is the 2nd consecutive month of weaker price rises â€“ we havenâ€™t seen that since August â€“ September 2015.

The majority of the slip is courtesy of the continual pricing out of the devaluation of sterling post the EU referendum, lower clothing prices as well as idiosyncratic changes courtesy of the rescheduling of the Budget until  EDT
04:55




The absence of new â€˜sin taxesâ€™ on booze and cigarettes this spring helped to keep inflation down (because the government has moved the annual Budget statement to the autumn).


Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the Office for National Statistics, says:





 

â€œInflation fell to its lowest rate in a year, with womenâ€™s clothing prices rising slower than usual for this time of year. 

â€œAlcohol and tobacco also helped ease inflation pressures, with tobacco duty rises linked to the Budget not appearing this March, thanks to its new autumn billing.

UK inflation hits one-year low

NEWSFLASH: Britainâ€™s inflation rate has fallen to 2.5%, a one-year low.

Thatâ€™s down from 2.7% in February, and another sign that the cost of living crisis is easing, given that wages are currently rising at 2.8%.

The Office for National Statistics says:





 

The largest downward contribution to the change in the rate between February 2018 and March 2018 came from prices for clothing and footwear rising by less than they did a year ago, with the effect coming mainly from a range of items of womenâ€™s clothing.


Price movements for alcoholic drinks and tobacco also made a downward contribution to the change in the rate; this in part reflects changes to the Budget cycle that were introduced in 2017, with tax changes for tobacco being announced in November 2017 instead of March 2018.

A planned merger to create Britainâ€™s biggest property company has been abandoned, in the face of UK retail gloom.

Hammerson, which owns Bicester Village and Birminghamâ€™s Bullring, has ditched its takeover of smaller rival INTU, which owns a string of shopping centres around the UK.

Hammerson walked away after concluding that the deal was too risky, given the weakness in the UK retail sector at present.

It says:





 

The Board of Hammerson reassessed the proposed acquisition of Intu in light of updated information on current market dynamics in the UK. Over the last five months, the financial strength of retailers and other tenants in the UK has softened and a number of retailers have entered into administrations or CVAs, while consumer confidence has also remained subdued. 




Itâ€™s an embarrassing u-turn for the company, which really ought to have spotted such problems in its own sector.

But given the recent collapse of Toys R Us and Maplin, and profit warnings at Debenhams and Mothercare, it also feels like the right decision.

Shares in Hammerson have risen by almost 3% this morning, while Intu have slumped almost 6%.

There are red faces at banknote printer De La Rue this morning, as it counts the cost of the â€˜Brexit blue passportâ€™ farrago.

De La Rue has abandoned its attempt to appeal against the decision to award the contract to print Britainâ€™s new bank notes to French-Dutch rival Gemalto. 

In an unscheduled announcement to the City, De La Rue hit shareholders with a profits warning - the second in a month - and revealed it is taking a Â£4m hit on the UK passport contract.

My colleague Angela Monaghan explains:





 

The company, which also makes the new polymer bank notes, warned that underlying operating profit was now expected to be in low to mid Â£60m range for the year to 31 March. It followed a profits warning less than month ago, when De La Rue predicted profits of between Â£71m and Â£73m.

Todayâ€™s UK inflation report could send traders racing to buy, or sell, the British pound.

It all depend whether the data make an early interest rate rise more likely, as Konstantinos Anthis, Head of Research at ADS Securities, explains:





 

Inflation in Britain is one of the key data investors and traders are following as it relates to how fast and aggressively the Bank of England will hike rates. We know that the BoE want to raise their key interest rate levels during their next two meetings but the actual timing of the move is still under debate.

The poundâ€™s price action largely depends on when market participants believe the British central bank will pull the trigger and the pace of inflation is key in gauging when this will be.




The pound is trading at $1.429 this morning - a weak inflation report could send it sliding to $1.425, Anthis says.

The agenda: Inflation in focus







Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the global economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.

Inflation is centre-stage today as we find out how the cost of living changed in the UK and the eurozone last month.

Britainâ€™s consumer prices index is tipped to come in around 2.7% in March, matching Februaryâ€™s reading and away from Januaryâ€™s 3% peak.

If so, that would confirm that the cost of living squeeze is easing - yesterday we learned that UK wages rose by 2.8% in the last quarter.



Alison Wrynn 
(@alison_wrynn)
Data released today shows that UK real wages grew (0.1%) for the first time in a year as nominal wage growth (2.8%) was just enough to surpass inflation  17, 2018


The data may also influence the chances of the Bank of England raising interest rates next month, which has already driven the pound to 22-month highs yesterday.

Wednesdayâ€™s FINANCIAL TIMES: â€œInvestors push sterling higher with bets on rate rise next monthâ€� #bbcpapers #tomorrowspaperstoday  17, 2018


Royal Bank of Canadaâ€™s analysts predict that inflation might actually drop to 2.6% today, given the recent easing in petrol prices.

They add:





 

The recently announced price increases by British Gas, of 5.5% for both gas and electricity, donâ€™t take effect until the end of May so wonâ€™t have any impact on the forthcoming release, however, in the second half of 2018, factoring in this utility bill hike will add an estimated 0.05-0.1ppts to annual CPI rates.

It remains to be seen whether other energy providers follow British Gas, but in any case it reaffirms expectations that inflation will remain above the 2% target into 2019.




Inflation is rather lower in the eurozone, of course. The annual euro area consumer prices index is expected to remain at 1.4% for March, although prices probably picked up during the month.

Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group explains:






 

Todayâ€™s inflation data from the eurozone could show signs of a pickup having been lacklustre for the past year. Whilst CPI is forecast to be 1.4% on an annualised basis, on a monthly basis an uptick to 1% from 0.2% is forecast.




Weak eurozone inflation is great for consumers in the region, of course, but it could also make it harder for the European Central Bank to end its massive money-printing Quantitative Easing stimulus programme this autumn.

The International Monetary Fundâ€™s Spring Meeting is continuing in Washington; two new reports on the state of the global economy will be released later.

Plus, the Bank of Canada is setting interest rates today; itâ€™s likely to leave borrowing costs unchanged at 1.25%.

2018-04-19,20328.625,ABB Ltd: Profitable growth,"""We started 2018 with order growth in all divisions, improved revenues and operating results. The integration of B&R is well on track and we are preparing diligently for the closing and subsequent integration of GE Industrial Solutions which we expect to happen in Q2 2018,"" said ABB CEO Ulrich Spiesshofer.

""We are continuing to invest in sales, R&D and our leading digital solutions portfolio ABB Ability. With our streamlined and strengthened ABB and the transition year 2017 behind us, we have our focus firmly on our customers and relentless execution,"" he added.

Macroeconomic signs are trending positively in Europe and the United States, with growth expected to continue in China. The overall global market is back to growth whilst still impacted by uncertainties in various parts of the world. Oil prices and foreign exchange translation effects are expected to continue to influence the company's results.

Total orders rose 6 percent (16 percent in US dollars), up in all divisions in the first quarter compared with a year ago. Base orders (base orders are classified as orders below $15 million) increased 5 percent (15 percent in US dollars), reflecting growth across all regions. Large orders represented 10 percent of total orders, the same level as a year ago.

Change in US dollar exchange rates versus the prior year period resulted in a positive translation impact of 7 percent on reported orders. Changes in the business portfolio related to the acquisition of B&R off-set by divestments made in 2017 had a net positive impact of 3 percent on total reported orders. The book-to-bill ratio was 1.13x compared with 1.07x in the first quarter of 2017.

Total services orders grew 8 percent (15 percent in US dollars), representing 19 percent of total orders.

Regional demand patterns were mainly positive in the first quarter:

In ABB's key customer segments, the following trends were observed:

Revenues grew 1 percent (10 percent in US dollars) year on year. In the Robotics and Motion and Electrification Products divisions, revenues were well-supported by continued solid order growth. This was tempered by steady revenues in Industrial Automation and lower revenues in Power Grids due to the lower order backlog at the end of 2017 in these divisions.

Service revenues were 8 percent higher (15 percent in US dollars) and represented 18 percent of total revenues, compared with 18 percent a year ago.

Change in US dollar exchange rates versus the prior year period resulted in a positive translation impact on reported revenues of 7 percent. Changes in the business portfolio related to the acquisitions of B&R and the divestments made in 2017 had a net positive effect of 2 percent on total reported revenues.

Operational EBITA was $1,060 million, 4 percent higher in local currencies (12 percent in US dollars). The operational EBITA was supported by net savings and positive volume and mix, partly offset by commodity prices. ABB continued to reinvest savings in growth over the quarter. The reported operational EBITA margin for the quarter improved to 12.3 percent, an expansion of 20 basis points when compared to the prior year period.

Net income was $572 million, 21 percent lower in US dollars. Excluding non-operating items, which in the first quarter of 2017 included a gain from the divestment of the cables business, ABB's operational net income2 was $669 million, an increase of 10 percent in US dollars. Basic earnings per share of $0.27 was 21 percent lower compared with the first quarter of 2017. Operational earnings per share of $0.31 was 11 percent higher, and 6 percent higher in constant currency terms.

Cash flow from operating activities was -$518 million, compared to $509 million in the prior year period. The lower outcome relative to a year ago was mainly driven by the timing of employee incentive payments, which in 2017 were paid in the second quarter, timing of cash flows for large projects, payables and receivables, as well as the timing of tax payments. ABB expects strong cash flow from operating activities in the second quarter and solid cash delivery for the full year.

Effective January 1, 2018, management responsibility and oversight of certain remaining engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) business, previously included in the Power Grids, Industrial Automation, Robotics and Motion operating segments, were transferred to a new non-core operating business within Corporate and Other. Previously reported amounts have been reclassified consistent with this new structure.

Third-party base order momentum continued, increasing 7 percent (13 percent in US dollars). Service orders also grew, contributing to total order growth of 1 percent (7 percent in US dollars). The division booked several large orders which partially offset a tough comparable from the prior year, which included a very large order for an HVDC link between the UK and France. Revenues were 4 percent lower (1 percent higher in US dollars) impacted by the lower order backlog at the end of 2017. The operational EBITA margin of 9.7 percent for the quarter was 20 basis points lower year-on-year, reflecting lower revenue and mix effects in addition to ongoing investment in the division's Power Up transformation initiatives.

Total orders improved 3 percent (10 percent in US dollars) and third-party base orders rose 5 percent (12 percent in US dollars), despite two fewer working days in certain key markets during the quarter. Revenues increased 2 percent (9 percent in US dollars) compared to the same period in 2017. Operational EBITA increased 6 percent, with the margin expanding 110 basis points year on year to 15.2 percent, driven mainly by volume growth, pricing improvements and sustained cost control.

Total orders improved 4 percent on a comparable basis driven by service and selective investment for mining and specialty marine vessel solutions. Third-party base orders were steady in the quarter from the high level in the first quarter of 2017. Including B&R and currency effects, total order growth was 26 percent and third-party base order growth was 24 percent compared to the prior year period. Revenues reflect strong base business performance which mitigated the order backlog in the quarter. The operational EBITA margin of 14.1 percent, up 40 basis points, improved primarily due to positive mix, successful project execution and cost savings.

Order growth was reported across all segments and regions in the quarter. Total orders increased 11 percent (18 percent in US dollars) and third-party base orders improved 9 percent (16 percent in US dollars). Revenues increased 8 percent (15 percent in US dollars) on strong execution of the order backlog. Operational EBITA margin was 15.3 percent, up 50 basis points year on year. Improved volumes and mix were aided by focused growth efforts and stronger markets, which in turnimprovedunder-absorption along with better cost control.

ABB has been executing its Next Level strategy since 2014 through the three focus areas of profitable growth, relentless execution and business-led collaboration. During this time ABB has transitioned its portfolio and operations into a market-orientated, focused, leaner company. ABB today offers two clear value propositions, bringing electricity from any power plant to any plug and automating industries from natural resources to finished products. ABB is driving profitable growth through four entrepreneurial divisions, continuing to invest in sales, R&D and its leading digital solutions portfolio, ABB Ability. ABB's operating model puts the focus of ABB's divisions firmly on operational execution, with stronger links between compensation and delivery of operational performance. Along with improving market dynamics, ABB is better positioned in a better market.

2018-04-19,20328.625,"Kathua rape case, ties with Pakistan, Opposition in India: Narendra Modi's top quotes from Bharat Ki Baat in London","Prime Minister Narendra Modi interacted with participants across the globe at Bharat Ki Baat Sabke Saath programme held in the iconic Central Hall Westminster in London on Wednesday.

Modi said people have more expectations from his government because they know that it can deliver. Commenting on the latest rape incidents that have sparked worldwide protests, Modi said that a rape is a rape, how can we politicise it.

""A little girl is raped, it’s such a painful incident. But will we say ‘these many (rapes) happened during your government’s rule and these many in mine’? There can’t be an approach more wrong. A rape is a rape. How can we tolerate such cruelty to a daughter?”

Modi also remarked on the current situation in India and the importance of democracy and India's relationship with Pakistan.

Here are the highlights from his interaction with the participants at Bharat ki Baat:

— ""I have never indulged in counting the number of rape incidents in this government and that government. Rape is rape, be it now or earlier. It is extremely sad. Don't politicise rape incidents... The rape of a daughter is a matter of shame for the country.""

— ""The person in the railway station was Narendra Modi. The person in the Royal Palace in London is the sevak of 125 crore Indians.""

— ""My life at the railway station taught me so much. It was about my personal struggles. When you said Royal Palace, it is not about me but about the 125 crore people of India.""

— ""If a person has a cycle, he aspires to have a scooter. If a person has a scooter, he aspires to have a car. It is his nature to aspire. India is getting increasingly aspirational.""

— ""Yes, people have more expectations from us because they know that we can deliver. People know that when they say something, the government will listen and do it.""

— ""During the freedom struggle, Mahatma Gandhi did something very different. He turned the freedom struggle into a mass movement. He told every person that whatever you are doing will contribute to India's freedom.""

— ""Today, the need of the hour is to make development a mass movement.""

— ""Look back at India's history. India has never desired anyone else's territory. During World War I and II, we had no stake, but our soldiers took part in the wars. These were big sacrifices. Look at our role in UN peacekeeping forces.""

— ""We believe in peace. But we will not tolerate those who like to export terror. We will give back strong answers and in the language they understand. Terrorism will never be accepted.""

— ""Those who like exporting terror, I want to tell them that India has changed and their antics will not be tolerated.""

— ""I do not need to read books to understand poverty. I have lived in poverty, I know what it is to be poor and belong to the backward sections of society. I want to work for the poor, the marginalised and the downtrodden.""

— ""18,000 villages did not have electricity. So many women do not have access to toilets. These realities of our nation did not let me sleep. I was determined to bring about a positive change in the lives of India's poor.""

— ""I am like any common citizen. And, I also have drawbacks like normal people do.""

— ""We have a million problems, but we have a billion people who can solve them.""

— ""One of the things I wanted to do in London was to pay homage to Bhagwan Basaveshwara.""

— ""The 125 crore people of India are my family.""

— ""What prevented Indian prime ministers from going to Israel. Yes, I will go to Israel and I will even go to Palestine. I will further cooperation with Saudi Arabia and for the energy needs of India I will also engage with Iran.""

— ""I want this government to be criticised. Criticism makes democracy strong.""

— ""My problem is not against criticism. To criticise, one has to research and find proper facts. Sadly, it does not happen now. What happens instead is allegations.""

— ""I was not born with an aim to be in history books. I request you all- remember our country and not Modi. I am just like you all, a common citizen of India.""

OTTAWA, ON / ACCESSWIRE / April 24, 2018 / SunContract, the world's first blockchain-powered peer-to-peer platform that empowers individuals to freely buy, sell or trade electricity was launched on April 13, 2018. In a high-profile event attended by officials from the European Union as well as the Slovenian government, SunContract, slated to revolutionize the monopolized energy market, was launched.

During the event, SunContract signed as many as 10 partnerships with energy sector partners as well as Blockchain partners. The company promised to provide more information about these partnerships in the coming weeks. Gregor Novak, CEO of SunContract said he was ecstatic with the partnerships they had signed. 'This proves that there are people and organizations that believe in our vision. The energy sector has been monopolized for long. Not anymore. Our platform gives the power right back into the hands of individuals, especially home owners, who can choose who to sell and buy energy from,' said Mr. Novak on the occasion.

In a market flooded with blockchain projects, SunContract finally brings an application for a crucial real world problem in the energy sector. Its assured success, starting from Europe, will open up exciting possibilities in retail markets and such a business model is bound to be replicated all around the world.

The philosophy underlying SunContract is pretty straightforward. Homeowners can now choose to become completely energy self-sufficient. They can choose to buy energy from other individuals who generate energy from the sun or other natural methods and they can also sell their surplus energy to members of the SunContract community. Through the platform, individuals can also buy solar power plants, heat pumps and storage units and select between a wide array of energy products and services. The platform also gives the power to decide on how much to pay for and sell home-generated, green and blockchain-backed energy. Through the platform, SunContract aims to create a self-sufficient, eco-friendly, green energy community.

The underlying blockchain technology ensures complete transparency and trustworthiness. Company officials said that they were in the process of streamlining the technological interface with the help of various partners to make the platform accessible globally in their effort to help create a community that supports small energy producers and connects them with individuals who would wish to buy energy from them at a much cheaper rate. The paramount aim of SunContract is to create a clean and green environment for future generations.

Dancing flash of light and pulsating brizzle above the car roof: the Faraday cage of the Siemens high-voltage test facility in Berlin measures 42 x 32 x 25 m. In the world's largest production facility for switching technology, a team of electricians and engineers is researching a lightning impulse voltage of up to three million V. The parabolic hall, built in 1958, houses a high-voltage surge generator for this purpose. Right in the middle: the Audi e-tron prototype. A flash of light dances over the car roof with a pulsating prickling sound and illuminates the 25 m high hall. The experts directed a voltage flashover at the vehicle.

This experiment symbolizes a millennia-old dream of mankind: the capture of lightning and the use of its energy. Although it is still not possible to charge an electric car with a flash, engineers are already one step closer to the vision of lightning-fast charging. The production version of the Audi e-tron prototype is the first car on the market to charge up to 150 kW.

At quick charging stations with the European charging standard Combined Charging System (CCS), for example in the Ionity network, the e-tron prototype is ready for the next long-distance stage in less than half an hour. The basis for this is the complex thermal management of the lithium-ion battery. Placed in the car floor, it stores 95 kWh of energy and thus enables a range of more than 400 km in the WLTP test procedure. By the end of 2018 there will be almost 200 such high-power charging stations in Europe, each with six charging points. By 2020, 400 locations are planned along motorways and main traffic axes, each 120 km away."

The Akademik Lomonosov, a floating nuclear plant, left St Petersburg todayThe £337million ($480million) Akademik Lomonosov was towed out of the St Petersburg shipyard ahead of its journey towards Murmansk, on Russia’s northwest coast.
The huge barge contains two nuclear reactors, and once loaded with nuclear fuel, the firm behind the plant says it will be capable of generating enough power for 200,000 people.
Some anti-nuclear campaigners have condemned the vessel as a “dangerous experiment”, with Greenpeace dubbing the boat a “floating Chernobyl”.
But the company behind the plant says it is “one of the safest nuclear installations in the world” and is kitted out with the latest security systems.
It also said many environmental campaigners have been supportive of the project because it will reduce air pollution caused by a coal-fired plant at its final destination in eastern Russia.
Greenpeace nuclear expert Jan Haverkamp said: “Nuclear reactors bobbing around the Arctic Ocean will pose a shockingly obvious threat to a fragile environment, which is already under enormous pressure from climate change.

""The floating nuclear power plants will typically be put to use near coastlines and shallow water … contrary to claims regarding safety, the flat-bottomed hull and the floating nuclear power plant's lack of self-propulsion makes it particularly vulnerable to tsunamis and cyclones.""
The 474ft Akademik Lomonosov is due to be towed through the Baltic Sea for the first leg of its journey, before moving around Norway to its destination north of the Arctic Circle.
Once in Murmansk, its reactors will be fuelled, before the vessel heads to Russia’s far east, where it will provide power for a port town and offshore oil rigs.
Rosatom, the company behind the floating plant, had initially hoped to fuel the reactors while it was docked in St Petersburg.

Campaigners have labelled the Akademik Lomonosov a 'floating Chernobyl'Anton Vaganov/TASS
The nuclear plant will eventually be moved to Russia's far eastBut pressure from residents and Norway’s Foreign Ministry forced the firm to rethink its plans.
In St Petersburg, 11,000 people signed a petition urging the company to fuel the vessel elsewhere.
But Rosatom disputes the claims made by Greenpeace and insists the floating power plant will not be an environmental threat.
It says the vessel will be replacing an ageing nuclear plant in Russia's far east which is scheduled to be decommissioned.
Following the launch of the Akademik Lomonosov today, Vitaly Trutnev, director of the Rosatom subsidiary responsible for the floating nuclear power plant, said: “It is a significant milestone for our project as well as for the whole world’s nuclear industry.

Fishermen sail past the Akademik Lomonosov as it leaves St Petersburg“Floating nuclear power plants will enable electricity and heat supply to the most remote regions boosting growth and sustainable development.
“Building upon three hundreds of reactor-years of safe operation of units powering icebreakers, floating nuclear power plant features the most cutting-edge safety and security systems and is expected to be one of the safest nuclear installations in the world”.
Speaking after the company announced the fuelling process would take place in Murmansk, Rashid Alimov, Greenpeace Russia’s head of energy projects, said: “Thousands of St Petersburg residents opposed what can only be described as a dangerous nuclear experiment, and they were heard.
“That proves that people clearly understand the risks that they could have been exposed to, and stand for their rights.”

The massive Akademik Lomonosov has no engines of its own and needs to be towedHe added: “Greenpeace still considers the very concept of a floating nuclear power plant too dangerous and a senseless technological solution”.
The Akademik Lomonosov is relatively small compared to modern nuclear power plants built on land.
It is fitted with two modified KLT-40 reactors, which are traditionally used to power large ships, which are capable of producing 70 MW of electricity or 300 MW of heat.
By comparison, the new Hinkley Point C nuclear power station planned for Somerset will have an electricity generating capacity of 3,200 MW."

2018-05-02,15579.249999999998,TSB chief Paul Pester to forfeit £1.6m bonus in wake of IT meltdown,"The TSB chief executive, Paul Pester, will forfeit a £1.6m bonus in the light of an IT failure that left thousands of customers locked out of their accounts – as MPs accused him of being “extraordinarily complacent”.

Appearing in front of the Treasury select committee, Pester and the TSB chairman, Richard Meddings, said they had received 40,000 complaints about the outage but did not know exactly how many of the bank’s 1.9m online customers had been affected.

They also declined to predict when the problems, which have been affecting customers for 10 days, would be fixed. The committee chair, Nicky Morgan, accused Pester of being “extraordinarily complacent” after he said the bank’s move to a new IT system, which triggered the problems, had mostly run smoothly.

Pester insisted that 95% of customers were now using the bank’s mobile app and website without problems.

However, MPs on the committee read out a series of emails and tweets from customers that cast doubt on Pester’s version of events. One customer said they had spent 14 hours on the phone to customer services, while another said they had been left unable to pay their gas and electricity bills.

Morgan questioned the notion that the problems were mostly fixed, saying customers had been put in an “impossible financial situation”.

She added that two Treasury committee staff members had found they could not log in during the evidence session, which led to an unexpected reply from Pester.

“It’s nice to know we have so many customers in the room,” he said. “Thank you very much for using TSB.”

Simon Clarke MP said Pester’s belief that most customers were now banking without problems could not be true unless there was a “mass conspiracy by members of the public”.

TSB has marketed itself in large part on its ability to provide better customer service than larger high street lending rivals.

However, customers began experiencing problems with their accounts on Monday 23 April after the bank – now owned by Spanish lender Sabadell – migrated from an IT system inherited from the previous owner, Lloyds Banking Group.

Sabadell had hoped to make more than £100m in annual savings by using the new system, known as Proteo in apparent reference to Proteus, a Greek god of the sea often associated with change.

Pester insisted the switch to the new system had been rigorously tested beforehand and was “running smoothly” for the most part but that it was struggling to deal with high levels of demand.

“It’s the equivalent of having a shop that’s too small to let the number of customers in,” he said.

He said around 50% of customers had experienced problems with their accounts on the first day of using the new system, with 40,000 complaining, compared to an average of around 3,000 during a typical 10-day period. Pester said around 22,500 have had their problem “acknowledged” by the banks so far.

Morgan referred to a comment made by the bank’s chief information officer in December 2017, who said the switch to Proteo would make TSB “a digital business that just happens to be a bank”. She said TSB “is neither a digital business, nor a bank. In fact it’s a broken bank.”

Pester and Meddings said customers would receive compensation from TSB, not only for any financial loss but also for emotional distress and inconvenience, adding that no customer would be left “out of pocket”.

The accountancy firm Deloitte is advising on the compensation strategy, while TSB has recruited IBM to fix the IT problem and the City law firm Slaughter and May to investigate the cause.

Meddings told MPs that Pester had volunteered to give up a £1.6m bonus associated with the bank’s migration to the new IT system, hinting that other executives could also have their bonuses slashed at the end of the year.

“We apologise profusely for the issues we’ve caused our customers,” Pester said, adding that it had been a “terrible decision” to go ahead with the switch to a new IT platform.

But he said that TSB was needed to challenge the so-called Big Five high street banks and provide greater competition. He said he believed customers would still continue to switch from larger banks to TSB, despite the impact of the IT failure on the bank’s reputation."
2018-05-02,15579.249999999998,Technisches Englisch (Teil 5): Electricity,"Not only computers make our lives easier nowadays, it's even harder to imagine our lives without electricity. Our ancestors still used candlelight instead of light bulbs and had to do without electrical outlets. Most people today rely on electricity like they do on food and water. What would life be like without electricity to power our favourite video games, TV shows, telephones and even the lights you read by at night? It allows us to enjoy life in so many ways and without it our daily lives would be much less convenient. We get so used to flipping the light switch and seeing the lights come on that we forget how much we rely on electricity until the power goes out. From lights to alarm clocks to refrigerators to washing machines, electricity plays a critical role throughout the day. But let's see how our electrician Jack Wire explains his special subject to Lucy.

Jack: So, Lucy, today is the big day. I'll show you my workshop where I will hopefully teach you something about my job. Come on in, my dear, this is my kingdom.

Jack: …to be invented, only discovered and understood. Most people think that Benjamin Franklin was the one who discovered electricity. He was one of the greatest scientists of his time and discovered and invented many things, including bifocal glasses for example.

He also believed that lightning was a form of this flowing electricity.

 ON TRACK TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABILITY GOALS AMID INCREASED REGULATIONS, GREEN CONSUMERISM AND INVESTMENT



 City Developments Limited (CDL) has published its latest Integrated Sustainability Report 2018: On Track To CDL Future Value 2030. The report shows CDL's progress towards the material Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) goals and targets under its CDL Future Value 2030 sustainability blueprint. Against the backdrop of increased regulations and demand for sustainable products and investments, the future-fit blueprint drives CDL's integrated sustainability strategy towards 2030, a milestone year for global climate agreement and sustainable development.



 

 

 With Singapore's impending carbon tax in 2019 and the increase in water tariff since July 2017, prudent businesses must map out their resource-efficient strategy and measures to manage rising costs. In 2017, CDL achieved the following:

- 32.8% reduction in carbon emissions intensity from 2007 levels, on track to meet its 38% target for 2030

- 27.3% reduction in energy use intensity from 2007 levels, achieving its 25% target for 2030 ahead of time

- Over S$20 million savings in electricity bills as a result of energy-efficient retrofitting and initiatives implemented for eight CDL-managed commercial buildings from 2012 to 2017



 As Singapore steps up its commitment to the Paris Agreement by designating 2018 as the Year of Climate Action, CDL is proactively taking steps to reduce its carbon emissions and reliance on fossil fuel energy. It targets to join RE1003 - a global renewable energy campaign led by The Climate Group in partnership with CDP - by reviewing a 100% renewable energy target for its operations by 2050.



 

 According to survey results by market research firm YouGov[2] released in January 2018, more than half of Singapore consumers prefer sustainable brands as they believe businesses have a responsibility to prevent environmental damage. The survey also found that 88% of Singaporeans think businesses have a responsibility to do social good. The results are consistent with other surveys such as the 2017 Nielsen's Global Sustainability Report, which points to a growing desire among Singapore consumers to verify the sustainability credentials of the products they buy[3]. Over the years, CDL has strived to develop buildings and spaces that are user-centric and environmentally-friendly. In 2017, CDL achieved the following:

- 100% of CDL's owned- and managed-office buildings attained Green Mark GoldPLUS and Platinum, the highest tier certification

- 100% tenant participation of CDL Green Lease Partnership Programme, which actively engages and encourages commercial tenants and occupants to adopt low-carbon practices at the workplace



 Geared up for More Effective Climate-related Financial Disclosures 

 

 Globally, investors and financiers are increasingly rewarding companies with good ESG performance. A 2017 MSCI study[4] showed that corporations with good ESG performance have outperformed in profitability and equity in the long term compared to those with poorer ESG performance. In 2017, CDL issued the first Green Bond by a listed Singapore company which raised S$100 million as an alternative financing stream for CDL's green building efforts.



 Many stock exchanges worldwide have also introduced measures that encourage listed companies to disclose their ESG performance. Supporting the call for better climate-related financial disclosures to inform longer-term investment decisions, CDL is among the first Singapore companies to pledge its support for the Recommendations of the Financial Stability Board (FSB)'s TCFD7 launched in June 2017. TCFD comprises 32 members, including the Singapore Exchange (SGX), chosen by the FSB to represent users and preparers of disclosures from across the G20's constituency covering a broad range of economic sectors and financial markets.



 As recommended by the TCFD, CDL has voluntarily published its climate-related financial disclosures in four key areas - governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets -in its latest Integrated Sustainability Report. As more investors question the climate risk exposure of companies in their portfolio, scenario testing against climate change is expected to take centre stage in 2018. In line with the TCFD's recommendations, CDL has also commenced a climate change scenario analysis in early 2018 to assess climate-related risks and opportunities across its key portfolio in three major markets - Singapore, China and United Kingdom. CDL is studying two scenarios - a 2 degrees Celsius ( C) scenario and a business-as-usual 4 C scenario - to better inform its strategy in managing the financial impacts that climate change will have on its business. The study is slated to complete in mid-2018.



 Mr Sherman Kwek, CDL Group Chief Executive Officer, said, ""Sustainability is fast becoming the norm throughout the business ecosystem. From a very early stage, CDL has recognised the importance of ESG integration. For more than two decades, we have incorporated sustainability into our business and operations to futureproof our business and unlock value. More than just a developer of living and working spaces, we have strived to be a builder of lives and communities. Our longstanding commitment to innovation and green building has distinguished CDL as a trusted ecodeveloper and differentiated our products. The enhanced value of our manufactured capital has benefited our business, customers and investors, and supported the well-being and development of the communities which we operate in. This has not only raised our operational performance, resource efficiency and productivity, it has driven innovation, opened new opportunities and attracted likeminded investors.""



 Ms Yeo Lian Sim, a Vice Chair of the TCFD, said, ""The Task Force recommends what companies need to disclose so investors can assess and respond to climate-related opportunities and risks. Five Singapore companies have pledged their support for climate-related disclosures according to TCFD standards and CDL is one of these companies who have taken the lead. An important TCFD recommendation is for resilience of company strategy under different climate-related scenarios. CDL is undertaking this and should gain from what it learns as much as will investors from its disclosure.



 CDL's latest and 11th Integrated Sustainability Report continues to be in line with the Global Reporting Initiatives Standards and International Integrated Reporting Council's Integrated Reporting principles, which CDL has adopted since 2008 and 2015 respectively. To ensure the level of accuracy and transparency, the Report is independently assured by Ernst & Young in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised).

Billowing clouds of thick dust and sand frequently blow across the region during the dry season, but the death toll from this week’s storms has been unusually high.

At least 64 people have died in Uttar Pradesh state, most of them in Agra district where the Taj Mahal is located. Another 35 are confirmed to have died in Rajasthan and two each in Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh. The death toll in all four states could still rise.

The destruction has extended to Punjab and Haryana, where trees were uprooted and power supplies cut by the squall. Less intense storms in Delhi caused traffic jams and flight diversions.

At least 160 animals also died in the storms, according to officials in Uttar Pradesh.

The dust clouds were trailed by thunder and lightning storms, heavy rain and strong winds that were expected to last another 24 hours at least.

Most of the deaths occurred when houses people were sleeping in collapsed overnight, disaster management officials said. Falling pylons and trees also contributed to the death toll.

The dust storms are created by a rapid ascent of warm air, which creates a vacuum that air closer to the ground rushes to fill, taking sand and dust with it.

Meteorologists said abnormally high temperatures in past weeks had contributed to the disaster. “It can be called a freak accident,” Mahesh Palawat, a meteorologist at the private forecaster Skymet Weather told the Hindustan Times.

“Dust storms are usually not this intense nor do these systems cover such a large area.”

India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, who is in southern India campaigning ahead of an important state election, said he was saddened by the loss of life. “Condolences to the bereaved families,” he tweeted. “May the injured recover soon.”

Similar storms last month killed at least 19 people in Rajasthan and 15 people in Uttar Pradesh, where they also damaged the Taj Mahal. Heritage officials said the monument had not been affected by the past week’s storms."

2018-05-04,20602.9,Siemens unveils natural gas engines capable of running on different fuels | NGV Journal,"Siemens  presented  its  new  high-efficiency,  low-emission  gas  engines  at  the  6th China International Bioenergy and Biomass Utilization Summit in Shanghai. One of the advantages of these new engines is that they can use a wide range of fuels to generate electricity and heat. They can be powered by natural gas, biogas, gas from landfills or sewage treatment plants, synthesis gas, well gas, or a wide selection of other gases, which means they can supply a wide range of industrial sectors.

Siemens  is  developing  these  engines  in  its  new  Power  and  Gas  division  business, Siemens Engine Business, which aims to resolve and overcome many of the obstacles currently affecting industry. Together with Siemens’ heavy investment in R&D and the experience  it  has  gained  over  more  than  50  years,  this  makes  Siemens  Engine Business a leading international technology provider in both liquid and gas fuel engines for a wide range of applications and sectors.

Standing out among its products, high-efficiency, low-emission gas engines can be used in several applications such as cogeneration, electricity generation, and waste-based energy. These engines use the latest fuel injection and supercharging technologies, which boost their power, reduce their fuel consumption, and optimize their maintenance costs.

The SEB factory in Zumaia (Guipuzcoa) has spent more than 50 years designing and manufacturing  high-performance engines in Spain that are exported the world over, largely to countries such as Argentina, the United States, Egypt, Morocco, Turkey, Pakistan, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia and, of  course,  all  over  Europe. The power ratings of the SEB portfolio range from 150 to 2065 kW for gas engines/generators.

One of the company’s most important research and development facilities is in Miñano, in the Spanish Basque Country. The company has developed a new technology, Siemens Fuel Blending solution, at this facility that allows an engine run on 100% biogas, 100% natural gas or a blend of both. This system enables engines to run even when the primary fuel is not available because they can change from biogas to natural gas at the press of a button. An automatic change to 100% biogas takes place as soon as the engine reaches nominal speed.

This dynamic fuel blending system is especially designed for use in situations with biogas restrictions; fuel can be switched 100% in such a way that the engine’s operability is not affected. One of the main advantages of Siemens engine flexibility is that it provides a safe, efficient and reliable power supply system even when the fuel supply is interrupted."

Danish GreenHydrogen, Spanish Clantech and Calvera, and Rennerod-based Gesellschaft für Windenergieanlagen GmbH (GFW) & Co KG have devised a solution that makes hydrogen production green and local to minimize environmental impact and expense.

GFW, which provides electrical power from wind turbine farms, will produce hydrogen fuel using advanced alkaline electrolyzers from GreenHydrogen, which convert electricity into hydrogen, at two different locations.

One electrolyzer will be placed next to an existing Fuhrländer FL1000 wind turbine, which will produce green hydrogen when the wind is blowing rather than selling it to the grid. The clean hydrogen then will be compressed using a Clantech containerized solution, compressing the hydrogen to 300 bar before it is stored in a “H2Pod Virtual Pipe Line” from Calvera. This solution facilitates the easy distribution of green hydrogen to customers, the first of which is the Rennerod transit system, which operates buses powered by fuel cells. It also allows the fuel to be produced and consumed locally, which eliminates transportation costs and any carbon footprint.

Another electrolyzer will be installed at the GFW facility, where it will be powered by an existing solar farm. There will be 15 additional tracker systems installed in the solar farm that will deliver 300 kW. The hydrogen produced by GreenHydrogen’s alkaline electrolyzers will then be stored in Calvera units at different pressure (300/450/900 bar) and, finally, be distributed from the hydrogen refueling station (SIDE H HRS) supplied by Clantech – at 350 and 700 bar.  The HRS will be made publicly available in order to support the increasingly use of all hydrogen-powered vehicles.

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - May 7, 2018) - Exro Technologies Inc. (CSE: XRO) (OTCQB: EXROF) ('Exro' or the 'Company') is pleased to announce an industrial collaboration agreement with Potencia Industrial, a global manufacturer of high efficiency motors and generators based in Mexico City, Mexico.

The agreement provides for a joint development collaboration for three projects with the goal of improving various aspects of motor/generator performance by integrating Exro's Dynamic Power Management technology ( 'DPM') into Potencia motors and generators.  The three projects include:  1) an electric motor for a car conversion kit; 2) a generator for a small wind turbine; and 3) electric motors used in trams and trains.  The collaboration contemplates the companies will enter into further detailed agreements as work progresses.

'We are excited to work with such a proven leader and innovator,' said Mark Godsy, Exro CEO.  Potencia's electric motors and generators are used around the world and often in the most challenging of circumstances because of their uncompromising quality.'

'We are delighted to work with Exro,' said Carlos Gottfried, president of Potencia Industrial. 'A successful collaboration could have far reaching impact for our industry, for our customers, and for the environment.'

More information about each area of focus in the collaboration agreement follows:

The first application will be for electric motors that Potencia currently manufacturers for its car conversion kits. The conversion kit allows for a gas motor of an economy-sized car — the most prevalent car type in the world -  to be swapped out and replaced with an electric motor.  Potencia is currently introducing its car conversion kit to a sizeable market of car owners who want the lower operating costs and/or the zero-emission benefits of an electric car without having to replace the whole vehicle.

Potencia and Exro will work together to integrate Exro's DPM technology into the electric motor with a view of providing additional torque management. This feature will potentially allow the motor to operate more efficiently in a variety of speed and load conditions which occur as a car accelerates, decelerates, climbs up and down hills, and/or operates at higher speeds. Exro's DPM technology reconfigures the coils in a motor, providing more flexibility for power and torque, which traditionally has been a limitation for electric motors because they don't have the transmission systems of gas-powered motors.  The expectation is that Exro's DPM technology will allow for a greater range of efficiency in circumstances where the designers of electric motors have had to choose between torque or speed.

The second application will focus on a small wind turbine which Potencia currently offers for sale. Here the parties will collaborate by integrating Exro's technology into a 5 kW generator. By reconfiguring the coils within the generator and adding Exro's DPM technology, the parties anticipate being able to produce more consistent voltage under varying wind conditions, leading to better overall system management and consistent energy production, which is key for offering electricity for sale or efficiently charging a battery.

A second aspect of the collaboration will explore efficiencies that may be gained when using Exro's DPM technology compared to a traditional generator working at similar speeds and torque under variable wind conditions.  This exploration has the potential for far reaching impact not just for the wind industry, but also for other types of renewable electrical production where there is a variable energy source such as tidal, wave, or river.

The third application will focus on electric trams, trains and high-speed trains. Potencia currently sells electric motors for each of these markets throughout the world. Here the parties will collaborate by integrating Exro's DPM technology into motors for each of these respective markets.   Like the car converter kit application where existing limitations of a motor require a tradeoff between speed and torque, the parties hope that with Exro's DPM technology, such a tradeoff may no longer be necessary, giving the motors a greater range of efficiency, which could reduce operational strain on the motor, provide greater energy efficiency, and allow for better selection of motor sizing.

Exro Technologies Inc. offers the potential to accelerate the transition to clean energy by improving the efficiency and reliability of fuel-powered electric motors and generators, which make up about half the worldwide market for electric power.

Exro's patented coil technology works for electric motors and generators, dynamically adapting input and output with the goal of achieving specific, measurable performance gains in applications ranging from electric cars, UAVs, pumps, ship drives, industrial motors, vacuums and anything else powered by an electric motor or generator.

Potencia Industrial designs and manufactures special application, high efficiency electrical motors and generators. Specializing in creative solutions and applications, Potencia meets the highest technical requirements in power security and energy efficiency. Its state of the art machines meet and exceed the most stringent customer specifications and maintain IEEE, NEMA and IEC standards. Potencia has set several industry benchmarks in permanent magnet generator, kinetic energy storage, and high efficiency patented technologies.

Structured under vertical integration, Potencia meets engineering and manufacturing challenges with the experience of a solid 50-year background. Potencia's vertical integration of its manufacturing processes include lamination stamping, core assembly, welding and fabrication, high-precision machining, coil manufacturing, winding, assembly and laboratory testing.

2018-05-09,20378.275,Malaysia's former leader set to become world's oldest PM at 92,"Former Malaysian leader Dr Mahathir Mohamad is poised to become the world’s oldest prime minister after defeating Najib Razak in a fiercely contested election that put an end to the ruling coalition’s six-decade hold on power.

Mahathir, 92, who was prime minister between 1981 and 2003, led the opposition coalition, Pakatan Harapan, to its first election victory since Malaysian independence in 1957, winning an outright parliamentary majority. He will be sworn in by the king on Thursday.

A euphoric mood gripped Malaysia at the announcement, which many had believed impossible. “We are so happy, such a proud day for Malaysia,” said David Thaiga, 57, who joined others in the street to celebrate. 

“We have been waiting for this for the past 60 years. This is a miracle for us. And even though I was not a fan of Mahathir, I think he was the only one who could have brought this victory.”

Sukumira Sekhar, 84, witnessed the beginning of Malaysian independence and lived through 60 years of rule by the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, said: “I’m so happy I survived to see this. I wish I could jump up and down for joy, but be sure my heart is jumping up and down. I’m so proud of the people of Malaysia, especially the young people and the Malays who swung it.”

Mahathir’s win marks the end of the nine-year tenure of Najib, who came to power in 2009 and whose reputation was tarnished by the 1MDB corruption scandal in which $2.6bn was embezzled from a government fund he was overseeing – including $681m that was alleged to have ended up in his personal bank account.

The scandal 


1Malaysia Development Berhad, was set up in 2009 to promote economic development. The Malaysian prime minister, Najib Razak, chaired its advisory board and, according to the US Justice Department, top executives and associates of Najib looted $4.5bn from the fund between 2009 and 2014, laundering it through the US, Singapore, Switzerland and other countries. Hundreds of millions landed in Najib's bank account, though he denies any wrongdoing. 





Where the money went


The US Justice Department is seeking to recover money from the fund it says was gambled in Las Vegas, used to buy hotels, apartments, a luxury yacht, a jet, diamond jewellery, art works and to finance Hollywood films including the Wolf of Wall Street and Dumb and Dumber To.  





The investigation


US prosecutors have alleged layers of foreign bank accounts and shell companies were used to launder the money and named Low Taek Jho, a friend of Najib’s stepson, as a key figure in the conspiracy. In one email he wrote ""Looks like we may have hit a goldmine"" after organising a 1MDB deal that would later allegedly become a money laundering vehicle. 

Singapore has fined eight banks for failing to carry out proper anti-money laundering measures in relation to 1MDB and given prison sentences to several bankers.





Political impact


A parliamentary inquiry found many irregularities but had no mandate to prosecute so, outraged by the scandal, 92-year-old former leader Mahathir Mohammad came out of political retirement and opposition united behind him for the elections. The government recently passed a ""fake news"" law that could be used to further stifle reporting on the case within Malaysia.








Thank you for your feedback.





Mahathir’s victory marks the first time that a Malaysian prime minister will not be from the UMNO party and not be part of the BN coalition, of which UMNO is the main constituent.

The win indicates that a mood for change has gripped the country, following the “Malay tsunami” in which many ethnic Malay voted for the opposition for the first time. 

Voter turnout was 76% – lower than in the 2013 election – but the opposition took many states that were considered BN strongholds such as Johor, Malacca, Negeri Sembilan, Selangor and Penang.

The campaign also galvanised the youth vote for the first time, with young people taking to social media to add their support to the opposition.

“This is a pure adrenaline rush. We have been waiting for this change for the longest time,” said Naveen Kumar, 31. “We have been infected with a BN government for so long and now it’s a total relief.”

Dr Mahathir Mohamad was Malaysia's longest-serving prime minister, holding office from 1981 to 2003. He is credited with overseeing a period of economic growth but was also notoriously authoritarian, cracking down on the opposition, the judiciary and the press. Mahathir selected Abdullah Badawi as his successor, but toppled him in 2009 after poor election performance and installed another protege, Najib Razak, as prime minister.

Having officially retired, Mahathir then denounced Najib in 2015, after the 1MDB scandal broke. In 2018, it was announced he had switched to the opposition party, and, at 92-years-old, would be running against as prime minister to bring down Najib. If he wins, he will be the oldest leader in the world.

Shaliz Kumar, 28, said: “The young people had a big part to play in this. I called all my friends to make sure they had voted.”

The official results, usually announced by 11pm, were not released until around 3am, and some alleged that Najib was trying to stall the announcement. Constituencies that were swinging towards the opposition also reported electricity blackouts, hindering the final count.

In the end, however, Najib made no public statement after Mahathir had claimed victory in the early hours of Thursday morning.





'This election is personal': Mahathir Mohamad, 92, vows to stop 'corrupt' protege









Mahathir’s selection as opposition leader had made this an unusual election: he was an UMNO member when he first came to power in 1981, and played a key role selecting his protege Najib as prime minister in 2009. 

The relationship soured in 2015 after Najib was implicated in the 1MDB scandal, and this year Mahathir announced he was not only forming his own political party, Bersatu, but switching sides and joining the opposition coalition.

Najib had initially been expected to win easily, but, as campaigning picked up, the opposition dominated the narrative, raising issues such as corruption and the rising cost of living. 

After claiming victory on Thursday morning, Mahathir was asked whether he would seek to prosecute Najib for his alleged role in the 1MDB scandal. “We are not seeking revenge, we are seeking to restore the rule of law,” he said.

As part of his agreement with Pakatan Harapan, Mahathir will only be prime minister for two years, and then will cede power to Anwar Ibrahim. Anwar, who was also once Mahathir’s protege, is currently in jail serving a second sentence for sodomy.

Mahathir and Anwar fell out publicly in 1999 and Mahathir was responsible for jailing Anwar, but the pair put aside their differences in their united desire to take down Najib.

The plan now is for Mahathir to have Anwar pardoned so he can take office. “He’ll be released in June,” said Mahathir. “Once he’s pardoned, he’s eligible to be PM again.” Mahathir also announced after his victory that he would appoint Wan Azizah, Anwar’s wife, as his deputy prime minister.

The police have warned people against gathering in the streets to celebrate in case of rioting; however, a large group gathered outside the Pakatan Harapan headquarters in Petaling Jaya to cheer and wave flags. 

For Dr Mohan Mahatheva, who was in the crowd, “tonight this is true freedom for Malaysia. We freed ourselves from colonialism, now we have freed ourselves from kleptocracy,” he said. “At least I know my children will live in a truly independent Malaysia.”"

2018-05-15,27970.699999999993,Construction begins on gas pipeline connecting Germany to Russia,"Preparatory work for the construction of a controversial Russian gas pipeline began off the German coast on Tuesday, just days ahead of a visit to Moscow by German chancellor Angela Merkel.


	""Nord Stream 2 AG today started the offshore preparatory works for the subsequent pipe-laying in the Bay of Greifswald"" on Germany's Baltic Sea coast, the building consortium, led by Russian gas giant Gazprom, said in a statement.


	It said the work was in line with planning approval granted by German authorities, and that similar offshore work had begun off the coast of Finland where approval has also been granted.


	The pipeline, Nord Stream 2, will follow the track of the existing Nord Stream 1 pipeline and will double the amount of Russian gas arriving in the European Union's most powerful economy via the Baltic Sea when it is finished in late 2019 to 110 billion cubic metres per year.


	The pipeline has proved controversial, in particular in eastern European EU states, who fear it could be used as a tool to boost Russian influence over the bloc.


	Moscow notoriously used gas prices to pressure Ukraine during a mounting conflict with its former satellite which saw Russia annex the Crimean peninsula in 2014 -- prompting EU sanctions in response.


	Nord Stream 2, by increasing Gazprom's capacity to deliver gas directly to  Germany, will give Moscow even more ability to route gas exports around Ukraine.


	Transit of Russian gas through Ukraine has declined since the first NordStream pipeline opened in 2011.


	Merkel unexpectedly threw German support for the pipeline into question last month when she said it could not go forward unless there were guarantees for Ukraine concerning current overland gas transit.


	While Gazprom signalled its willingness to maintain transit of gas via Ukraine, it only offered lower volumes, prompting Ukraine to reject the offer.


	Merkel is to travel to the southern Russian city of Sochi on Friday to meet President Vladimir Putin where gas transit is expected to be discussed.


	In Russia, the project has been criticised on environmental grounds by  Greenpeace, which has called for the route to be changed to avoid the Kurgalsky wildlife preserve near Saint Petersburg.


	It said on Tuesday work had been started ""illegally"" in the preserve, destroying dunes and wetlands, while also disturbing birds during the critical nesting season.

2018-05-15,27970.699999999993,Chasing Paradise: A Palestinian Clan Dreams of Going Home - - International,"It acts like a magical word. It lights up rooms. It gives everything a purpose. It is the goal. The direction. The solution. When Yahia Khalout utters the word on this afternoon, a light seems to go on inside him. The word is ""Ni'ilya.""


  
	




	



Khalout is 55 years old, he has a gray moustache and black eyes that usually appear to be peering into a bottomless abyss. He is sitting with a dozen men in the shell of a house in Jabalia, the biggest refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. It's raining outside. The men, who are wearing tracksuits, have assembled around a bed as if it is a sacrificial altar. Yahia Khalout's seriously injured son is lying there. His name is Abdullah and he is 23 years old. He's pale and wrapped in a fuzzy, colorful blanket. He was hit by a bullet while protesting at the border fence with Israel and is still too weak to tell the story of his survival, so his dad recounts it instead. It sounds like a ballad. A partisan song.


  
It goes like this: On the morning of the first ""March of Return,"" three friends set off for the fence. The sun has just risen. They have a Palestinian flag. All three are in their early twenties. They're going home. To their homeland, which they know is wonderful. Every Friday, Palestinians want to raise awareness about their situation in Gaza, where there are countless shortages, with a peaceful protest. They don't have enough food, water, work or freedom. The Friday marches are meant to bring them closer and closer to the border fence with Israel and, on May 15, Nakba Day, the dark day of the Palestinian people, they will reach the border. Nobody knows what will happen after that, but the three men get going.


  The first shot is fired when they are 200 meters (700 feet) from the fence. It hits the flag-bearer in the leg. The next man gets up, lifts the flag, walks a bit and then is also struck in the leg. Then the third man takes the Palestinian flag and carries it further. The man is Abdullah Khalout. The Israeli sniper's bullet hits him in the chest. They take him to the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza where his father works as a nurse. Yahia Khalout was treating a boy when he saw his bleeding son being carried into the emergency room. Abdullah had serious internal bleeding. He was in shock. They give him several transfusions and bring him to the Al-Shifa Hospital, the biggest in Gaza. The father accompanies his son. ""Forgive me, father,"" the young man says before losing consciousness. They operate for five hours, at which point a doctor appears in the waiting room and says, ""There's little hope, Yahia."" After another five hours, Abdullah wakes up to say, ""Tell mother she should forgive me."" Then, during the afternoon of the next day, a surgeon appears in the waiting room, takes the father by the shoulders and says, ""God has saved your son!""


  
	



And that's how it was. The prayer beads click in Khalout's hand. His son nods weakly. ""We have been fighting for 70 years against the injustice of the Israeli occupation,"" Yahia says. ""My family has provided 60 martyrs. Sixty. I sat in an Israeli jail for five years, in the Negev Desert, for this struggle for the rights of my people. My son has now continued this fight. We are almost there.""


  Where?


  ""In our homeland,"" says Yahia Khalout. ""In Ni'ilya.""


  
	



The light inside him turns on. He smiles, even his eyes smile. The word has turned an angry man into a happy one. All the men are now smiling, including the one sent by Hamas to monitor and make sure the international public was being appropriately informed. Ni'ilya is the name of the village the family comes from. It's located about 20 kilometers away, on the other side of the border. A small village south of Ashkelon, which they call Majdal. None of the men in the room have ever seen Ni'ilya. But all can describe it. The houses, the fields, the trees. 


  ""We had oranges and grapes,"" says Yahia.


  ""Almonds,"" says another man.


  ""Melons.""


  ""Apricots.""


  ""And grain,"" says Yahia. ""We brought it to the market in Majdal and sold it there. My grandfather had 150 dunum of land."" That translates to about 15 hectares.


  
A Huge, Intertwining Clan



  They all know the size of their ancestors' land, but aren't as familiar with the circumstances under which they were driven out of that paradise. In 1948, during the Arab-Israeli War, the inhabitants of many Palestinian villages fled to Gaza. The cause of this flight -- a war in which the Arab neighboring states intervened because they didn't like the idea of an independent Jewish state in their midst, or because they didn't accept the UN's plans for dividing Palestine -- have either been forgotten or repressed by them, or smothered by the other terrible things that have happened to the Palestinian people. The wars, the blockades, a society in neverending transition, living in refugee camps whose tents became first huts and then houses. The only constant has been the feeling of great injustice that began 70 years ago, on Nakba Day.


  ""Ni'ilya: Ethnically cleansed 25,280 days ago,"" says a Palestinian website that translates the displacement into numbers. 


  In November 1948, Ni'ilya was cleared. Back then, the village had 297 houses, and all except one were destroyed. But the families from Ni'ilya still exist. Indeed, they have grown with time. The 1,520 Palestinians who left Ni'ilya in 1948 have turned into around 60,000. They live across the world, in the United States, Germany and Saudi Arabia. But most are in Gaza. Yahia's family alone now has over 1,000 members and is related to another family from Ni'ilya, the Yassins, a huge clan with intertwining relations that are hard to decipher. There are 10-year-olds who are uncles of 40-year-olds and siblings whose birthdays are 30 years apart. But all of them ultimately come from this village of dreams. From Ni'ilya. 


  It's a place that holds together all these people with different names and faces, like a path leading through this enormous family. 


  If there is a kind of central square on this path, it might be Sad Aladin Yassin, a distant brother-in-law of Yahia Khalout. Yassin is 68 years old and was born in a tent in Gaza one year after his family left Ni'ilya. His father was a farmer and owned 150 dunum of land, Aladin Yassin says right from the start. Then come the orange trees, the shade, the peace. And the smile.


  Sad Aladin grew up with three brothers and two sisters. Now he has 60 grandchildren, a long beard, a walking stick and a Samsung Galaxy, which he uses more than his prayer beads. There's always someone who wants something from him. Sad Aladin is the imam at the mosque in Jabalia, where 120,000 people live in an area that measures just 1.4 square kilometers. It is one of the biggest mosques in Gaza. His cellphone's screen saver is a selfie with the words ""Jerusalem is the capital of Palestine"" emblazoned over it.


  One morning between two marches, Sad Aladin Yassin is sitting in one of the tent camps that has been built up at the border, and talks about the upcoming May 15, the fateful day. The fence is located about 500 meters from here. They will overcome it, the imam says. Some predict that hundreds of thousands of Palestinians will head to the sand rampart where Israeli snipers await. According to the organizers' plans, they will all be holding hands.


  And then? Will they simply continue to Ni'ilya?


  ""It is our land,"" says the imam. ""We will return. Soon.""


  And what will happen to the people who live there now?


  ""They are welcome to visit us. From time to time,"" he says. ""We don't want war. You need to tell that to the world, including German readers. The Zionist media control the global media. They speak in different tongues. They are the true aggressors. Two of my nephews have been shot at during the peaceful demonstrations. They are still children.""


  After an anti-Semitic fit, like a dry cough, the imam is smiling again. In the afternoon, after prayers, he extends an invitation to his home to introduce his family, the children of Ni'ilya.


  
Brandishing Injuries like Trophies



  The two injured boys sit amid the men. They brandish their bandaged legs like trophies. Pride, pain medication, attention. Yahia Khalil Yassin is 11 years old and the uncle of Mahdi Yassin, who is 16. The young uncle was shot at during the first Friday march. His nephew on the following Saturday. They both claim to have been far from the border fence. When it comes to children, the Israelis shoot at their feet, Mahdi says, but they shoot older ones in the knees, to make them immobile forever. He would like to go back next Friday on his crutches, but his family won't allow it. 


  His father shakes his head. The imam smiles. The two boys are missing school and their exams. This summer, final exams have been pushed back in Gaza anyway because of the Nakba anniversary and there are special classes in which the injured students can catch up on their lessons. Thus far, 490 underaged youths have been injured in the Friday marches. Mahdi and Yahia have been at home for four weeks. Mahdi's injury is healing well. Yahia's wound is still infected. He needs further operations because his joint is affected. His orthopedist says he will never again be able to walk properly. Three times a week, two nurses from Doctors Worldwide, a Turkish aid organization that has been working in Gaza for three years, visit the boys to change their bandages. 


  Yahia remains impassive as the nurse treats him. He would really like to show his injury. His foot is swollen, with a small hole on the instep, a larger one, with rough stitches, at the heel. He is beaming.


  ""This is what the occupation makes out of us,"" he says.


  Before the nurses leave, the 11-year-old signs the forms with an air of experience. 


  How bad is the pain? 


  ""Middling,"" says Yahia, laughing. 


  ""He even laughs when he's crying,"" his mother says.


  At this point, about 20 family members are sitting in the living room: uncles, aunts, brothers, sisters. There's tea, coffee and waffles. The imam is sitting between the injured boys. Yahia, the young uncle, describes his homeland: cool, calm, an old house, surrounded by orange trees.


  It's something he can look forward to. A kind of future. Yahia is a good student, they say, but where will that get him? His older cousins, nephews and brothers have no work. Some went to college -- most of them, surprisingly, studied something relating to media -- and they now sit around at home all day and wait for something to happen. Youth unemployment in Gaza is 70 percent. None of them has ever traveled. They sit in a cage, surrounded by fences on three sides and on the other side the sea, in which they cannot swim because it is polluted by the unfiltered sewage coming out of Gaza. Their greatest hope is that things will someday be as nice as they once were.


  The only person in the room who was born in Ni'ilya is Mohammed Ibrahim Yassin, the imam's older brother. He's 71 years old, and he was just 1 year old when they left. He, of course, has no memories of fleeing. But he went back once, in the 1960s, with his father. He was so happy to stand on the soil of his homeland, he says. He found it even nicer than the stories he had heard from his parents.


  It's totally quiet in the room.


  ""All I want is 100 square meters to build my own house. And a small garden,"" says Mohammed Ibrahim Yassin. 


  It is the most concrete plan for a future on the other side of the fence uttered by anyone in the family. It seems as if they can't really imagine what would happen if the fence came down. 


  ""The food in Ni'ilya was so much better than it is here,"" says Yahia's mother.


  ""Grapes.""


  ""Lemons.""


  Yahia's eyes light up.


  ""Don't worry, you will see it soon, Yahia,"" says his sister, Ghada Khalout. She's at least 30 years older than her brother. She lived in Germany for 13 years, in Graubündener Strasse in Bremen, she says. Her husband, a brother of Yahia Khalout's, was an engineer there. He died of cancer and so she returned to Gaza in 2013. One cannot move around as freely as in Europe, she says, but her family is here. And the memories of the golden era are also more alive here.


  
The Sheep Ate the Documents



  Ghada now has a new husband, Kreem Halawi, who is also sitting here. Because we are currently talking about Bremen, he mentions that he is impressed by Hitler. ""A great man. Not because of his behavior toward the Jews, at least not primarily,"" says Halawi. He said he was impressed by the energy and determination with which Hitler led his people out of the Depression. Halawi spent time in an Israeli jail, from 1986 to 1991, because of his political work for Fatah, he says. He claims they tortured him. He speaks about it in such a relaxed manner, as if jail was a kind of training course. He later worked for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza, until Hamas took it over in 2006. Since then he has been unemployed. He wears a suit and an ironed shirt. Every day. He keeps himself ready. He now has a wife who speaks German and who carries this Ni'ilya story with her. Palestinian traditions are intertwined. He has married into this dream. It doesn't matter that he has never seen Ni'ilya -- others haven't seen it either. At this point, there are around 30 people in the room. He's the only one who is not a Khalout or a Yassin. There is warm bread, olives, spices and sweet juice.


  ""We have documents and also the keys to our house in Ni'ilya,"" the imam says.


  Can he show them?


  ""I don't know exactly where they are.""


  ""The sheep ate them,"" says his brother Mohammed.


  ""Right,"" says the sister-in-law from Bremen. ""We had sheep here earlier, when the house didn't have a roof yet.""


  And the key?


  ""Sheep eat everything,"" says the brother of the imam. Nobody smiles. The sheep ate the documents. That's just how it is.


  ""Key or no key,"" says the imam. ""It's our land. That land remains. That's what we want back. And compensation. The Koran says that the occupation will end someday. And the Jews know this. They know that they will pay us. They are afraid of it. That's why the Zionist global movement is trying to destroy the Islamist movement.""


  Is there absolutely nothing that the family took with it from Ni'ilya?


  Ghada Khalout says that she still has a dress that belonged to her grandmother. It is black and decorated with traditional patterns. But she unfortunately cannot show it. She left it with a relative in Bremen. The last piece of Ni'ilya is hanging in a closet there. Left behind on this epic flight. This journey has indeed been a very long one for them. 


  Ghada Khalout thinks of her grandmother, Halima, who might still have something. She was already a grown up when they fled. It is the end of the path through the large Yassin-Khalout family. Or the beginning. The oracle of Ni'ilya. 


  Halima Hussein Kahlout is 95 years old. She lies under one of these colorful, fluffy blankets in a small, darkened room. She is small and thin, her body's outline barely visible under the blanket, her eyes are hazy but her spirit is awake. She was 24 years old when they left Ni'ilya. 


  She says she didn't see any Jews in 1948. No soldiers. They fled from rumors coming from the north, heard from Palestinians traveling through from Jaffa. Maybe there were also shots fired from Majdal, she says. That could be. Ashkelon, which they call Majdal, was so close. She could hear the noise of its marketplace from her garden. She isn't sure. She only remembers the feeling of fear. Because of it, she made her way south, toward Gaza, with olives, fruit and bread as provisions. Everyone on foot. She and her three children. Two boys and a girl. The oldest son was 6 years old. Along the way, they met her husband, who had been in Gaza with a donkey and cart to sell grain there. He then took them with him. It was autumn. 


  She falls silent. A light breeze blows through the room. Then she resumes talking. A stream of consciousness from the past. Memories of life in Ni'ilya, clear of her grandsons' expectations. 


  ""I was 12 years old when I got married,"" she says. ""My hands were painted with henna.""


  ""There was a lot of land, where we grew grains and fruit. We sold them at the market in Majdal. There was no market in our village. We carried baskets and jugs on our heads. The British forbade us from carrying knives, but one of my brothers hid a weapon. One day the British came and turned the whole house upside down, but they found nothing. The British were stupid but cunning. We lost part of the land due to a deal over oranges with a Brit. He promised us wealth, but then a large load of oranges rotted on a ship because it got caught in a storm. I'm sure he knew about it beforehand.""


  Does she still remember her house?


  ""It was simple. We all slept on the ground. The floor was made of clay, the walls were made of clay. There were no windows.""


  Her nieces, grandsons and daughters all sit on the edge of the bed, their gazes downturned. 


  Tell them about the trees, mother. The blooming gardens of Ni'ilya. Please. 


  The organizers of the march also often end up speaking about the past when discussing their visions of the future. If you ask Dr. Yousef Saleh, the chief ideologue of Hamas, how he imagines a life living side by side with Jews, he answers: ""There is space for everyone. After all, we've lived together more or less peacefully for 3,000 years.""


  Saleh was previously the right-hand man of Hamas' leader. Today, he heads up the ""House of Wisdom,"" which he describes as a think tank. He is based on the 13th floor of a high-rise located directly on the beach in Gaza. Portraits of Gandhi, Mandela, Martin Luther King and Angela Merkel line the walls, and shelves display the souvenirs of his journeys around the world. Salah wears a uniform which looks as if his tailor was inspired by Kim Il Sung, Bertolt Brecht and Daniel Libeskind. He is sitting on a throne-like chair, lending him the appearance of being something akin to the god of Gaza.

  Outside in the salon, a Swedish professor is waiting. He's a friend of the Palestinian people. Saleh speaks about how impressed he is by the way people live together in Switzerland. Switzerland could be a role model for Palestine, he says. 


  Switzerland. In other words: even god doesn't have a clue where things go from here. 


  His room is full to the brim with Matryoshkas, Indian elephants and Gandhi portraits, but his thoughts end at the border with Israel. They have no clear idea of what paradise looks like, but they are always about it enter it. 


  Ni'ilya was cleared of people on Nov. 4, 1948. It doesn't exist on Israeli maps. There's no town sign, no houses -- just the coordinates on Wikipedia: 31°3846N 34°3418E.


  You have reached your destination, the GPS navigation system says at a dusty crossroads. There are scrubby hills to the left and the right, where wild apricot trees and thorny bushes grow, and there are also piles of trash. Here and there you can see the remains of old foundations. 


  Around 500 meters away, the new buildings become visible. Five and 10-story buildings, dozens of cranes. And beyond that is the skyline of Ashkelon, the city where Halima's children went to school and where they sold their fruit. The first school in Ni'ilya was built in 1948 but was never opened. It was torn down immediately along with all the other buildings. The mosque and graveyard are gone too. There's a new cemetery here where mostly Russian Jews are buried. 


  Two Bedouins are herding sheep and goats across the steppe. They come from Arad, around 75 kilometers to the southeast, in the desert near the Dead Sea. There's no grass there for their flocks, just sand. That's why they've come here, they say. To feed their animals. 


  ""Palestinians?"" one of the two shepherds asks. ""There are none here. Here, there are only Jews.""


  You can ask passing joggers or dog walkers about the history of this inhospitable area, but the minute the words ""Palestinian village"" are uttered they become tight-lipped and walk away. It's like a mysterious enchanted land, one that is somehow haunted. 


  Around four weeks ago, archeologists with the Israeli Antiquities Authority discovered a site here. They are now digging the ground in Ni'ilya and perhaps they will find proof that they were the first ones here. It's like everywhere in this country. If you can't come up with a convincing argument, you look for historical fragments to confirm your story. 


  What are they searching for in Ni'ilya?


  
	



The Antiquities Authority doesn't respond to inquiries. The fence here has a warning sign, there are motion detectors and a drone hovering overheard. It all seems a bit bizarre in this remote place. The cranes in the distance, the smell of trash, the thorn bushes, the lizards sunning themselves on the stones, and the boys tearing down dusty paths on dirt bikes. And yet the past, present and future are all here. The archeologists' bosses know that no new house on this disputed land will change the facts, not even if it is 20 stories high. Neither the ownership deeds nor Sad Aladin Yassin's old house key are decisive. It's about a better, older history.


  The villagers have fled, the houses are demolished, the paths obscured, the trees withered, the maps gone. But the name -- that can never be destroyed: Ni'ilya."

Theresa May's key Brexit legislation has been rejected by the Scottish Parliament in an unprecedented vote that paves the way for a constitutional crisis, says The Scotsman.
The Scottish Daily Mail claims the Conservatives' political opponents at Holyrood are the ""midwives for independence"" as the paper says it was ""patently obvious that Nicola Sturgeon wants a political crisis to provide cover for her independence drive"".
The National reports that politicians in London will press ahead with their controversial Brexit legislation and the disputed ""power grab"" despite an overwhelming vote against their bill by MSPs.
In other news, Britain's economy is entering a ""menopausal"" phase after passing peak productivity, Ben Broadbent, a deputy governor of the Bank of England has suggested.  The Daily Telegraph reports that he has compared the current slowdown to a lull at the end of the 19th Century, when the height of the steam era was over, but the age of electricity was yet to begin.
A blitz on eyesore shop fronts is to be launched as part of a multimillion-pound project to preserve the historic character of Edinburgh and help to maintain its world heritage site status, reports The Times.

2018-05-16,21952.875000000004,Deputy Bank of England Governor apologises for calling UK economy 'menopausal',"A deputy Governor of the Bank of England has apologised for calling the UK economy “menopausal” in an interview, saying that this was a “poor choice of language”.


The UK’s productivity has stagnated since the global financial crisis a decade ago, and data on Wednesday showed that its slipped again in the first quarter of 2018.


Ben Broadbent, deputy governor for monetary policy, had suggested in an interview with the Daily Telegraph published on Wednesday that this might be analogous to Britain’s “climacteric” productivity growth slump of the 1880s.




Mr Broadbent told the paper that climacteric means “menopausal, but can apply to both genders...you’ve passed your productive peak”.


He said: “I once got an economist into the [Monetary Policy Committee] to explain the origins of the word ‘climacteric’. As soon as he started talking to all these middle aged men – about [how] it means you’re past your peak and you’re no longer so potent – they all said: ‘We understand’.”


But later on Wednesday morning Mr Broadbent released a message saying: “I’m sorry for my poor choice of language in an interview with the Telegraph yesterday and regret the offence caused. I was explaining the meaning of the word “climacteric”, a term used by economic historians to describe a period of low productivity growth during the nineteenth century. Economic productivity is something which affects every one of us, of all ages and genders.”


Regardless of the semantics, the analysis does not imply that productivity growth will never return. 


After the 1880s pause the UK’s growth picked up rapidly as new technologies, such as electricity, were deployed.


Some economists argue that new digital technologies today mean that the UK and the global economy could be on the verge of another boom, despite the feeble performance of recent years.


Overall UK GDP growth slumped to just 0.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2018 according to the preliminary estimate of the Office for National Statistics. This was the weakest expansion in more than five years.


But overall hours worked grew by 0.6 per cent in the three months, meaning that output per hour productivity is judged to have fallen by 0.5 per cent.


This is extremely disappointing because it follows two quarters of the strongest productivity growth in the UK since the financial crisis in the second half of 2017, which some economists had hoped was a turning point.


The growth collapse prompted the Bank of England to hold off from raising rates again last week, despite previously signalling that it was likely to put up the cost of borrowing, although it still argued the latest UK growth figure was likely to ultimately be revised up to 0.3 per cent.




The Bank has come under fire for sending confused messages to financial markets on the likely timing of rate rises.


But Mr Broadbent brushed aside that criticism in his interview.


“I was in those same financial markets and it was my job. I have done it,” he said, referring to his previous career as a Goldman Sachs economist.


“We’re not going to spoon feed them meeting by meeting”.

2018-05-18,20719.9,New hydrogen project launched on Scotland’s Orkney Islands | NGV Journal,"The equipment for the road transport of gases at high pressure developed by Grupo Industrial Calvera, company based in Zaragoza (Spain), are a key element for the European BIG HIT (Building innovative green hydrogen systems in an isolated territory: a pilot for Europe) project, whose launch took place on the Scottish Orkney Islands with the assistance of institutional and business leaders from several countries.

Calvera’s five trailers are one of the basic pillars of this 60-month initiative that involves 12 partners from 6 countries with a budget of 10.9 million euros of which the European Commission awards 5 million through the Fuel Cells Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (FCH JU). The goal is to develop an integral infrastructure of production, storage, transport, distribution and use of hydrogen for energy supply purposes from the available local renewable sources, wind and tidal force.

The dispersion of the population of the Orkney Islands (20 islands with a community of 21,000 people) and the need to take better advantage of the renewable electricity production they already have (56 megawatts of installed power in wind turbines and tidal energy systems) generate 46 gigawatts per year of which 30% is not used due to overloads in electricity networks) offered the ideal conditions to carry out a project so, in addition to the global demo capacity, will solve the energy needs of the local population.

Complementing the Surf ‘n’ Turf ‘project, in which Calvera also participated, BIG HIT wants to use the surplus of renewable electricity generated in the islands of Eday and Shapinsay that cannot be consumed at the moment (about 2.7 gigawatt hours per year) to produce, through two proton exchange membrane electrolyzers (PEM) of 1 and 0.5 megawatts, 50 tons of hydrogen per year by electrolysis of water, which is stored at high pressure in the 5 Calvera’s specially designed trailers (each with a capacity to load a quarter of a ton of hydrogen) that are transported by sea to the island of Kirkwall.

There, hydrogen supplies a 75-kilowatt hydrogen fuel cell that provides heat and electricity to several port buildings and three ferries when they are docked, while powering 5 Orkney Islands Council’s fuel cell and zero-emission Renault Symbio Kangoo vehicles at a refueling station.

2018-05-18,20719.9,E.ON SE: E.ON and Google deepen solar partnership around Project Sunroof,"Dow Jones received a payment from EQS/DGAP to publish this press release. 

DGAP-Media / 2018-05-18 / 11:45 
 
*E.ON and Google deepen solar partnership around Project Sunroof * 
 
*- E.ON aims for photovoltaic market leadership in Germany* 
 
*- Sunroof will start in Great Britain, Italy in preparation* 
 
*- Google cooperation in Germany extended until the end of 2018* 
 
The solar partnership between E.ON and Google is developing into a European 
success story. Since May 2017, the joint Sunroof platform, which determines 
the solar potential of millions of buildings, has been bringing new solar 
energy systems onto German roofs. Homeowners can be happy: the one-year 
programme will be extended until the end of 2018. 
 
In addition, the success in the European pioneer market of Germany is now 
being exported. Over the coming weeks, Sunroof is being made available to 
homeowners in Great Britain. At the same time, E.ON and Google are preparing 
the market launch in Italy. As in Germany, E.ON will be the first energy 
company in Britain and Italy to offer its customers a digital assessment of 
the PV potential of their homes - simple, free of charge and personally 
tailored. 
 
In Germany the website www.eon-solar.de [1] has established itself as the 
first address for interested parties who want to take their power supply 
into their own hands. Well over 10,000 customers have requested a detailed 
initial analysis of their roof's solar potential. Sunroof is thus making a 
significant contribution to E.ON's strong annual revenues growth of 150 
percent in its solar business. E.ON's goal is to become Germany's market 
leader in photovoltaics in 2019 the latest. 
 
All you have to do is enter your address online. Based on a few additional 
parameters, the construction of a solar energy system can be planned. 
Sunroof's websites combine technologies such as Google Earth and Google 
Maps, 3D models and machine learning, i.e. automated software improvement, 
to provide an accurate estimate of a home's individual solar potential. 
Sunroof calculates how much sunlight falls on each roof during the year. It 
takes into account weather data, the position of the sun at different 
seasons, the area and inclination of the roof as well as the shade of 
surrounding buildings or trees. In the end, Sunroof ""translates"" the 
determined amount of light into energy and the potential cost savings. The 
data are calculated by the software company tetraeder as an additional 
Partner in the sunroof project. 
 
Based on this data, customers in Germany can request a complete package 
consisting of a photovoltaic module and the E.ON SolarCloud, optionally with 
Aura battery storage. In addition, E.ON provides a ""sunshine guarantee"" to 
ensure that the solar system achieves the calculated yields. The company 
compensates for lower values financially. 
 
*About E.ON* 
 
E.ON is an international private energy company headquartered in Essen, 
Germany, which focuses on energy networks, customer solutions, and renewable 
energies. As one of Europe's largest energy companies, E.ON plays a leading

2018-05-21,14624.650000000001,Ukraine ‘likely to need fresh IMF support’ – Voice Of Vienna,"Ukraine is likely to need a new IMF bailout program in the coming years to plug an up to $5.5 billion-a-year hole in its finances, the Institute of International Finance has warned.

Ukraine is hoping to get a long-delayed $1.9 billion tranche from its current IMF package in the next three to six months, but new analysis from the Washington-based IIF on May 21 aid out the country’s precarious longer-term picture.

Real exports are now roughly half the level they were in 2008, economic growth is a better but not stellar 2.5 – 3 percent a year and its energy import bill is rising in tandem with global oil and gas prices.

It’s the country’s external finances that pose the biggest risk though, the IIF said. For Kiev to remain “comfortable” next year, bond market lenders will have to ‘rollover’ — re-lend — 100 percent of their loans to the country. However, if that ‘rollover’ rate stayed at last year’s 85 percent level the government would face a $3 billion funding gap and one of $5.5 billion if rate dropped down to 75 percent.

“Unless capital inflows pick up substantially, Ukraine will likely need fresh IMF support in coming years,” to meet its needs, the IIF analysis said.

“The cumulative financing gap for 2019-21 could reach $16.5 billion, or 90 percent of international reserves in a low rollover rate scenario.”

Ukraine’s current IMF program is due to finish next year. The country has so far received $8.4 billion of what was originally supposed to be $17.5 billion of aid.

Its amount of short-term debt has fallen and its reserves have more than doubled during the program, but both are projected to reverse these moves as it comes to an end. Between now and 2021 it has $20 billion of IMF and other ‘official sector’ debt payments due.__Hurriyet"
2018-05-21,14624.650000000001,"Chakratec Raises 4.4 Million Dollars in Series C Round, to Bring Its Innovative 5-10 Minute Charging Technology for Electric Vehicles to Market","- Chakratec has announced the completion of its third financing round in which it raised 4.4 million dollars from the Israeli iArgento Group and the Singaporean company Goldbell. Chakratec's first investor was Capital Nature, which remains the company's largest shareholder. Chakratec has already raised 3.2 million dollars in its previous rounds. The present round will enable the company to conduct its first three pilot projects in Europe with three of Europe's leading utilities. The success of these pilots will lead to first orders later this year.
 
     (Logo:  )
 
Chakratec CEO Ilan Ben-David: ""Chakratec has developed an innovative EV charging technology that obviates the need for upgrading the power grid, enabling rapid deployment of fast EV charging systems. The company is currently conducting pilot projects with three global energy providers that see our technology as the solution for reduced EV charging times, and a facilitator for global market penetration by electric vehicles.""


 
Chakratec was established in 2013 by three high-tech entrepreneurs who pivoted their careers to clean tech: Ilan Ben David, Nir Zohar and Dudi Pincu. The company has developed a unique, innovative energy storage technology powered by kinetic batteries using a flywheel concept. These batteries provide a high-power energy supply, allowing a large number (tens to hundreds of thousands) of charge and discharge cycles over a lifetime of 20 years.
 
Until today, fast charging of electric vehicles required a high-power electricity connection, which often necessitates a costly, complicated and lengthy process of upgrading the distribution network infrastructure. The use of kinetic batteries makes it easy to deploy fast EV charging stations anywhere, integrating all kinds of energy sources, at extremely low operating costs. The charging process developed by Chakratec can be compared to the flushing of water in a toilet tank - when a strong flow is needed, a lever is pressed and the tank empties rapidly and then fills up again. Similarly, when a vehicle enters a charging station, the kinetic battery empties, rapidly transferring the energy to the vehicle, and then fills up again. Chemical batteries cannot be used for this application due to the number of cycles and high power required.
 
Chakratec has recently won the 2018 Outstanding Venture Award of the NREL Industry Growth Forum competition - the world's most prestigious competition in the field of renewable energy (NREL, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado, is a world leader in the field). The company has also won the 2017 eMove360oAward for Electric Mobility  Autonomous Driving, Energy Storage category.

2018-05-24,20398.725,Flow Batteries Market Expected to Dominate Worldwide by 2017 2025,"Different types of flow batteries are available in the market, including redox, hybrid and membrane less. One of the major benefits of using flow batteries is their ability to get instantly recharged by changing the electrolyte liquid. The used electrolytes can be simultaneously returned to the storage tanks, which makes flow batteries more flexible than solid state batteries. As a result, they perform better during deeper discharge cycles, making them a viable option for long duration applications as compared to conventional batteries.
In the recent past, flow batteries have been gaining traction and are finding adoption in utility companies with large systems being deployed and planned for the coming years. Flow batteries are scalable as their capacity can be increased by using a higher amount of electrolyte in the tanks, which is making them perfectly suitable for utility-scale grid applications. Flow batteries offer a longer operational duration and expected life with low total cost of ownership as compared to conventional systems. As flow batteries are becoming less expensive than other storage alternatives, the deployment rate will further increase to cater new wind turbines and solar panels to maintain grid reliability.
Request Report Sample@    
Flow Batteries Market: Drivers and Restraints
New electricity generating capacity of local renewable energy producers, such as solar and wind, which experience fluctuating power output will generate the need for flow batteries’ storage systems as they provide frequency regulation and voltage support for utilities. Vanadium flow batteries hold a major share of the market. As a result, the market price of vanadium will be the determining factor for the success of flow batteries among other energy storage technologies. The flow batteries energy storage system requires a high grade electrolyte, which remains short in supply as current production methods are costly for manufacturers. However, recent technical innovations are expected to reduce cost and address other industry needs and, in turn, are anticipated to drive the flow batteries market – making these batteries comparable with already established storage systems, such as lithium-ion batteries. The demand will increase substantially as electrolyte accounts for about one-third of the battery cost. Also, regional partnerships among key players will also play an important role in bringing production scalability and international reach in the flow batteries industry. Over the past few years, various flow battery makers have witnessed an increase in their sales revenue. The market players are entering into new supply chain agreements in an effort to create a vertically integrated supply chain model related to the sale, distribution and manufacturing of flow batteries.

2018-05-24,20398.725,E.ON SE: Artificial intelligence warns of potential power failures,"Dow Jones received a payment from EQS/DGAP to publish this press release. 

DGAP-Media / 2018-05-24 / 11:13 
 
*Artificial intelligence warns of potential power failures* 
 
Eliminating faults in the electricity grid long before they can occur: this 
is made possible by the use of artificial intelligence based on a technology 
developed in its present form by E.ON. It is now being used by 
Schleswig-Holstein Netz AG, a German grid operator belonging to the E.ON 
group. Combining comprehensive data analysis with a self-learning algorithm 
now makes it possible to predict faults and failures in the electricity grid 
much more reliably than before, and to take appropriate action much earlier. 
 
E.ON has been using this method in Schleswig-Holstein Netz AG's 
medium-voltage grids for around nine months. And the results are 
astonishing: ""The probability that we can predict a defect in the power grid 
has increased by a factor of two to three,"" explains Thomas König, 
responsible for E.ON's German grid business. ""And our customers benefit as 
well because possible sources of error that we identify in advance reduce 
the number of faults and make our grid more stable."" 
 
The new forecasting approach, also known as predictive maintenance, uses a 
variety of internal and external data such as the age and type of the power 
lines, maintenance and weather data as well as real-time information such as 
the current load behavior. The resulting forecasts open up completely new 
possibilities for the maintenance of the network infrastructure. 
 
By identifying potential sources of failure, the number of faults and 
failures can be reduced because the sources of a defect can be eliminated 
before the predicted failure occurs. For this reason, around a dozen 
maintenance projects in Schleswig-Holstein Netz AG's grids were brought 
forward in recent months. 
 
The new technology also improves planning for grid construction projects, 
which benefits municipalities in particular. For citizens and communities, 
improved maintenance means a reduction in construction activities and 
earthworks for repair purposes. For the company itself, it offers the 
prospect of allocating budgets and planning investments much better in 
advance. 
 
In recent years, E.ON has continuously improved the security of supply in 
its networks. At Schleswig-Holstein Netz AG, for example, the average 
downtime in 2016 was just 8.85 minutes, around a third lower than the 
nation-wide average of 12.8 minutes. 
 
This press release may contain forward-looking statements based on current 
assumptions and forecasts made by E.ON Group Management and other 
information currently available to E.ON. Various known and unknown risks, 
uncertainties, and other factors could lead to material differences between 
the actual future results, financial situation, development or performance 
of the company and the estimates given here. E.ON SE does not intend, and 
does not assume any liability whatsoever, to update these forward-looking 
statements or to align them to future events or developments.

2018-05-27,14959.225,Life after Tacheles: What’s become of the artist squatters?,"It was an artists’ utopia, a cultural institution, a tourist magnet: after over two decades on Oranienburger Straße, Tacheles was shut down, the artists kicked out. Five and a half years on, Taylor Lindsay tracked down the original clique to find out what came next.


If you walked down Mitte’s Oranienburger Straße at any point between 1990 and 2012, you would have likely noticed a commanding, if dishevelled, structure located just a short distance from the synagogue. Up until five years ago, the second-most visited art attraction in Berlin wasn’t the East Side Gallery or Museum Island, it was this five-storey building: aka Kunsthaus Tacheles. Taken over by artists after the Wall fell in 1990, the building was transformed into a creative commune. It was quintessential post-Wende Berlin: upon their occupancy, the artists launched a legal battle for the property and rescued it from demolition, maintaining a presence for 22 years.


At its peak, Kunsthaus Tacheles had a theatre, a bar, an event space, studios and nearly 100 creators from over 30 different countries all under one roof. There was no censorship, no middleman at the market. The doors to the house were open 24/7, and artists sold work right out of their studios. Everyone from critics to tourists, to students, to other artists wandered in and out of Tacheles, named after the Yiddish word meaning “straight-talk”. Some say the Kunsthaus became kitschy in its final years, producing “artsy” works deliberately catering to the tourist palate. Still, it was the only place of its kind.


But it didn’t last. The temporary lease, under which they paid a symbolic 50 cents per year, came to an end in 2008. For three more years the artists were once more illegally squatting, peacefully pushing back against investors, opposition and the city of Berlin (under Mayor Klaus Wowereit). Their lack of menace didn’t mitigate their determination – they stayed in the building, even as their electricity was abruptly cut off and different investors approached artists individually, offering them money to leave. Except for the café on the ground floor, most held out. Finally, city officials came and forced the last of them to vacate on September 4, 2012.


Thousands mourned and protested; the city had stamped out a crucial subculture and with it, a quintessential spirit. Or did they? Five years later, don’t look for Tacheles in the bereft building on Oranienburger Straße, now marooned on the edge of a vast desert of a development site. If you want a glimpse of the spirit today, look at the Tacheles Berliners who wouldn’t be subdued.



A new Tacheles in Lichtenberg?


Txus Parras, now 55, was one of the earliest internationals to arrive at Tacheles. At 26 he was travelling the world as an event technician, but he admits he always wanted to be an artist. Touring with a punk band called “Pogo” took him from Spain to Poland, and from Poland to Berlin. The first place he found was Tacheles. “And I never went back to Spain,” he says, grinning at the memory. He settled in and started creating.


Looking at his work now, it’s hard to imagine a version of himself that wasn’t making art. For one thing, he’s covered in it: buttons on his hats, rings on his fingers, lime green pants stamped with political slogans, and his accordion at hand. He designs psychedelic patterns for clothing, sculptures made from discarded doll parts, posters in at least three different languages, and tourist favourites like zines and painted records. The latter he sells at the East Side Gallery, which is where we first met him. When Tacheles comes up, he describes it like he was just there hours before. “It was free, it was open, there was this great feeling. We had the philosophy there that everyone is an artist. Everyone is an artist,” he insists with a guttural voice, talking with his hands. “And now we want to make a new artist meeting place, something with the spirit of Tacheles.” 


This “new place” is actually a thing, and the “we” he alludes to includes four other Tacheles originals: Tim Roeloffs, Peter Rampazo, Lucas Böttcher and his father Jürgen Böttcher. Named Kulturbotschaft Lichtenberg, the project began in February this year with a flurry of excitement as German newspapers initially dubbed it “New Tacheles”. There are some major differences though: the building’s address, Herzbergstraße 53, puts it right on the edge of the city, and the rent is €10,000 a month. But the founders moved fast, filling the three spacious floors with work spanning decades – from 86-year-old Jürgen Böttcher’s oil canvases dating back to the 1970s to new works from street artists who Parras met weeks earlier. Paintings, collage and silk screened shirts line almost every surface that isn’t a footpath in the artists’ studios. There’s a common area where the founders and a growing group of almost 60 people meet and cook together. Everything is peppered with colour. Fully peopled, it might look something like Tacheles. As for the rent, they’re making it work, one scrappy manoeuvre at a time; selling art, hosting events, or making deals with wholesalers, swapping designs for funds.


“Nobody is Tacheles more than us,” Parras says proudly of the project. “But it’s not a new Tacheles. We’re just incorporating the old philosophy of Tacheles; we want to keep the spirit that made it a social, cultural place, not just a functional one.” Is this all because he misses the original Tacheles? Partly. “Nobody wanted to go,” he says of the September eviction. “But actually, I didn’t really leave till December,” he grins. “They had to keep coming back for me.” 



Lessons from the Tacheles elders


While Parras is the project’s biggest proselytiser, Tim Roeloffs is at its core, though he credits the others for bringing the Lichtenberg building to life. When Roeloffs got to Tacheles in 1992, he wasn’t technically an artist either, coming instead from a family of Dutch farmers. His story is one of Berlin’s most famous: discovered by Donatella Versace at Tacheles in 2007, rocketed to fame, harangued by real estate sharks since 2011, and recently evicted from his home.


“It’s been a crazy time,” Roeloffs explains. “First I was kicked out of Tacheles. Then, this year, I got kicked out of my private working space. Then I got kicked out of the next place I went to work. And then I was kicked out of my home. But, somehow, I’m the happiest man in the world with this place,” he gestures around the Lichtenberg hub.


Like Parras, Roeloffs conjures up fervour and flavour when he talks about the old days at Tacheles, beer in hand, gluing together newspapers into canvas material as he speaks. “It was more than a workplace. You had input and output and exchange. I didn’t come from the art world; I learned in squats, and Tacheles was like my university.”


At “Tacheles Academy,” the new programme run by Parras and Roeloffs, a growing group of 20-somethings learn how to use scrap material and second-hand supplies to make art for sale. They show up to the Kulturbotschaft when they want, learn from the Tacheles elders, and spend much of their time out selling art on the street. “Everyone can do it this way,” says Roeloffs, who can build €200 wooden frames from roadside supplies. “You’re not ‘allowed’ to do this, in some people’s minds. Everyone’s in love with the idea of the starving, poor unknown artist. But if I make something today, I want to sell it tomorrow. Wanting to make money doesn’t make me less of an artist.” But these are just five of the Tacheles old guard. Where are the others?



The unofficial boss 


If Parras, Roeloffs and the Böttchers were the old “spirit” of Tacheles, a different group of people were more like the bones, the skeletal system that gave it a distinct – and perhaps controversial – shape in the last decade. This was a small body of five, handling operations, admin, tax, PR and politics, all the while artists themselves. Martin Reiter and Linda Cerna were at the helm of the group.


It’s no secret that Reiter wasn’t always popular with the Tacheles folk. But he’s unfazed by this today. “My position, if you want it in those terms, was to play the role of the boss,” he says slowly. “The boss gets involved with the politics, the market… when things get difficult, everyone needs to be able to point to ‘the fucked-up boss.’”


There was no ‘spirit’ of Tacheles at the time. Everyone is making up their own reality of ‘What Tacheles Was.’ It became a myth.""



When he came to Tacheles in 1993, it was by invitation. At age 27 he was already recognised in Austria for his paintings, sculptures, and specialty in robotics. He arrived to a slew of internal problems. “All the Western guys were there for the house and the money, at first,” he remembers. Later, sub-groups formed. “The groups weren’t so much divided by house, downstairs, and yard, but rather: the guys who just wanted to make money, the guys who fucked up because they drank too much and thought that made them artists, the touristic-art guys, the pragmatic and open-minded artists, and the crooks. The worst were the people who said, ‘I am the Tacheles.’ I never said that, because no one person could say that and it be true.”




    

    





     

    He went to the courts to battle for Tacheles several times: first in the 1990s for the 10-year lease, and again from 2008 to 2012 trying to get a new contract. “We won that first battle: we kept the building. But it was only a 10-year contract. In a speech to the others I said that we cannot take this 10-year contract, because in 2008 they will definitely throw us out. But the group didn’t follow that idea, so in the end we signed the contract. I wanted to keep going until we were the owners of the house.”


Unlike the Lichtenberg fellows, Reiter dismisses the idea of a “spirit of Tacheles” existing as such. “These are buzzwords, there was no ‘spirit’ of Tacheles at the time. Everyone is now doing what people do with religion. They’re making their up own reality of ‘What Tacheles Was’, because it’s in the past. It became myth. The facts are: we squatted a house, we painted pictures, and we got famous because a small group of people fucked with the economy, the bank and the politicians of Germany. If we hadn’t done that, nobody would give a shit about Tacheles.”


But he clearly does, despite the edge in his tone. After the dust settled, he set up and started managing The Tacheles Archives in the basement of a small building in Potsdam. Its drawers are overflowing with artefacts, filled with meticulously filed photos, flyers and catalogues. Paintings hang on every wall and stacks of files cover the floor, like a messy bedroom where he can remember “exactly where everything is.” This is what’s left of much of the art of Tacheles itself: about 250 works the artists left behind. When he’s not maintaining the archives, organising small exhibitions, or making a living teaching robotics, he meets and collaborates with artists from the old days. One of them is Linda Cerna.



Housekeeping in a squat  


Cerna came in 2008, as the 10-year lease was running out and the artists were trying to find a new way to secure the house, buffeted at every turn by Mayor Wowereit’s unwillingness to help and investors clamouring to turn Tacheles into a brand for new real estate. A Freie Universität graduate, she wanted to get into cultural management and thought an internship would be the best route. “I wanted to go somewhere that interested me, that I cared about. So, I went straight to Tacheles. I found Martin and asked for a chance. He just said ‘Well, you can try!’” When Cerna successfully organised the massive archive into an in-house retrospective exhibition in a matter of weeks, she was there to stay.


The organisational team had to contend with complex internal politics at the time. This included enforcing the “rent” system: artists paid about €200 a month for the electricity, gas, water, and a smattering of tax necessities. There was more than a little pushback. “We wanted to be as democratic as possible when it came to the art, the projects we could make happen. But we couldn’t be democratic about deciding whether we pay for electricity or not. It’s not just about making art and welcoming people, it’s about cleaning the toilet and keeping the power on too.”


And then there was the outer, PR layer: “We contacted politicians and asked for support. We took all the legal steps we could to save the house, knowing that in the end the only way to save Tacheles was if the city of Berlin really wanted to save it. In the end, they decided not to,” says Cerna, telling us of a particularly embarrassing incident in which artists sent a set of symbolic keys to the mayor when it became clear they would be evicted in September, along with an open letter that said: “The house is yours now, we hope you keep it an art place for the city.” Two days later, Wowereit had given the keys to an investor, apparently not knowing that it was a symbolic gesture – the investors’ hired hands went to the building while it was dark and tried all the doors with the keys.


Post-eviction, Cerna kept working with the artists both in Berlin and abroad; she helped set up the archives with Reiter, and she was invited to the Casoria Contemporary Art Museum in Naples to do a Tacheles-themed exhibition. She now organises communication for art fairs, including Berliner Liste. She’s disconcerted by the city’s unwillingness to save the living landmark. “It wasn’t the cost, because we financed it ourselves. If you look at it objectively, the project was something the city should have been proud of, it was special; people don’t come here to visit the shopping malls. It was a big loss for Berlin.”



Exporting the myth 


Of course, the gentrification of the last decade only fanned the flames of that loss. Some artists left the city after their studio space idyll was gone. Barbara Fragogna, also a member of the organisation team, returned to Italy after the eviction. Like Cerna, she too witnessed the final five years, coming to Berlin in pursuit of an artistic career and moving into a small flat just down the street from Tacheles. At the time, no one was doing the tedious work she eventually took over: running and structuring a programme for the frequently used 400sqm gallery and accompanying catalogues. Independently, she kickstarted exchanges with artists from Italy. She now employs the organisational flair she brought to Tacheles in her Turin-based Fusion Art Gallery.


At the mention of another similar project in Berlin, Barbara laughs kindly. “Maybe if Martin and Linda were doing it, I’d come back for that. A big organisation like that can only thrive if you have a lucky cosmic moment, the perfect combination of people… We used to say, we would vote for Linda for queen of the universe.”


But she remembers the tension, too. “We could have been evicted at any moment. Everything felt precarious. Once, we were suddenly occupied by security men from the bank,” she says, recounting the time a group of hired vandals broke into painter Alexandr Rodin’s fifth-floor studio. “They were all dressed in black. I could see one of them had a swastika tattoo. They squatted his studio and destroyed some work. It felt like living with a parasite.” It took two months of back and forth in the courts (costs shouldered in part by Martin Reiter) to get a legal order forcing them out.


“Sometimes we wondered if we should just close it ourselves,” she sighs. “It’s so psychologically and physically tiring, to work in a place where you invest all your time and energy and you don’t know when it’s going to end. During the last days we were planning to improve the house and solve the structural problems – but we needed more finances. I think if we’d been permitted to keep the building, we would have found a way. Even though we lost the property in the end, it’s impressive how far we got.”



What about the others? 


For the artists who aren’t founding a new art centre or hanging out with the organisational team, there is no single trajectory that accounts for the last five years. Some started galleries that quickly closed. Some are still in Berlin selling art or drugs. At least three committed suicide after the eviction. Some even attempted, unsuccessfully, to create a “New Tacheles” in Marzahn in 2013.


And some are still arguably thriving, filling the gap left by Tacheles with their own thrifty solutions to support their creative careers. Experimental musician and painter Kurihara Takuya remembers it all: the stressful last days, the loss of electricity, the dissent within the house. He kept to himself and “stayed out of the politics,” continuing to put on experimental music shows with friends on Monday nights in the building’s event space. “I was offered money by the lawyers from the bank’s side to leave, but I kept turning it down – I wanted to keep my studio.”


When Tacheles closed, he moved his art into his 20sqm apartment in Neukölln where he still lives today. Pieces are lined up against the walls about a foot deep into the room where he sleeps. He can’t afford to create and sell full time, so he supplements his income by washing dishes nine hours a week at a restaurant and selling his work on Sundays at Mauerpark.


“Tacheles helped with my future. I have connections to galleries and clients who visited me back then. Being there forever wouldn’t have been ideal for me anyway. I wanted to take the next step as an artist, stage proper exhibitions, go other places. When it closed, it sucked: I lost the place my income was coming from. But it turned out okay – better, even. There was no option to go back anyway.” He motions to his current surroundings. “We all had to go forward.”


It seems, then, that Martin Reiter’s statement was true: the spirit of Tacheles could be a “myth” in the sense that anyone could make what they wanted of it later. But those who are actually making something of it now – recording history, teaching young Berliners, organising festivals, building Italian galleries, or just simply creating – are using that myth for something. This seems fair. They are, after all, its authors.

2018 TBD"
2018-05-28,21106.925,Meet OPEC's Secretary General Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo,"The Nigerian HE Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo (محمد باركيندو) is the current OPEC Secretary General since August 1, 2016. / Picture: © OPEC - Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
  His Excellency Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo of Nigeria assumed office on August 1, 2016 in his role as Secretary General of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) at the OPEC Secretariat. Mr. Barkindo was officially appointed to the post for a three-year term.

Previously in 2006 he served as OPEC's Acting Secretary General and chaired the ECB - Economic Commission Board during the period 1993-2008. He also led the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation during 2009-2010.

Receiving the Abdullah Bin Hamad Al Attiyah Energy Award for Lifetime Achievement

Recently he was presented with the Abdullah Bin Hamad Al Attiyah Energy Award for Lifetime Achievement for the Advancement of OPEC, at a ceremony in Doha, Qatar. The Award was a recognition of the role the Secretary General played in the adoption of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation,’ which has had a transformative impact on the global oil industry.

“I am receiving this prestigious award on behalf of OPEC who together with our non OPEC partners have joined hands to assist the oil industry restore stability to the markets through the historic “Declaration of Cooperation,” after the longest and most destructive oil cycle in history” he said.

Oil price stability thanks to the OPEC Declaration of Cooperation

Mr. Barkindo recently at the 22nd International Exhibition  Conference ""Oil  Gas Uzbekistan (OGU)"", in Tashkent gave an insight into how OPEC has regained stability under his leadership.

""OPEC, in cooperation with a group of 10 other non-OPEC producers, held extensive consultations in the latter half of 2016. This effort eventually achieved an historic decision in December 2016 of voluntary adjustments under the name of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’. We have now been implementing this decision for the past 17 months with visible positive outcomes that have been widely acclaimed around the world.

The success of this Declaration has been undeniable with conformity rates reaching impressive levels throughout 2017, rising to well above 130% in recent months. In March, it reached a new record of 149%.

An additional six producers – including Uzbekistan – have provided further impetus to our efforts by declaring their solidarity with the Declaration.

In terms of the short-term impact on the growing stock overhang, the achievements have been significant, with the collective efforts of the producers involved continuing to yield positive results. OECD commercial stock levels have been adjusted from a peak of 3.12 billion barrels in July 2016 to 2.83 billion barrels in March 2018, corresponding to a drop of 300 million barrels, and the stock overhang has been reduced by 400 million barrels.

At the same time, we are seeing robust demand growth, which is forecast at around 1.65 mb/d in 2018. This, in turn, is supported by a healthy global economic outlook, with GDP growth expected at around 3.8% for this year. We also witnessed prices rebound from a low of below $30/b in January 2016 to recently reach the highest levels we have seen since November 2014.

According to OPEC’s most recent World Oil Outlook (WOO), the majority of the energy demand growth in the 2015-2040 period comes from non-OECD countries with around 29 mboe/d, while some 5 mboe/d is located in the mature markets of OECD countries.

Long-term oil demand is expected to increase by 15.8 mb/d, rising from 95.4 mb/d in 2016 to 111.1 mb/d in 2040. In the long term, more than half of the oil demand growth is expected to be satisfied by light products. Separately, the demand for middle distillates is anticipated to increase by 6.8 mb/d during the forecast period.

One of the important lessons learned from the most recent and perhaps worst prolonged oil market downturn in history is this: We must always be vigilant of market signs and indicators; and that we must always have the mid and long term in mind as we make our short-term calculations and decisions. Recognizing that something needed to be done in direct response to this recent market downturn was a positive, constructive response by responsible global producers.

Another lesson, however, is that we can and should no longer act in isolation. The complexity and interrelated nature of markets and economies today requires concerted efforts to ‘not go it alone’ and to instead seek ways to work together in common cause. Collective problems require collective responses – and this is something that the international community continues to learn.""

Background

An oil technocrat and veteran of OPEC, Mr. Barkindo brings with him a experience in the oil and gas industry, both in Nigeria and internationally.

From 2009 to 2010, he was Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). Previous to that, he served as Deputy Managing Director of Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas, a joint venture between NNPC, Shell, Total and Eni. Earlier in his career, he was Special Assistant to former Minister of Petroleum Resources and OPEC Secretary General, HE Dr. Rilwanu Lukman.

Mr. Barkindo also worked in several key roles at OPEC between 1986 and 2010. In 1986, he was appointed to Nigeria’s delegation to OPEC, and from 1993 to 2008, served as Nigeria’s National Representative on the Organization’s Economic Commission Board. In 2006, he served as Acting Secretary General of OPEC, and represented Nigeria on OPEC’s Board of Governors from 2009 to 2010.

He has also helped produce the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto protocol as the leader of Nigeria’s technical delegation to the UN negotiations since 1991. He also served as Vice President of COP15 in 2010, when he chaired the opening session in Copenhagen attended by more than 100 heads of state and government. He is the longest serving member of the country’s delegation to the UNFCCC. He also served as Chairman of the OPEC Task Force of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development for the 15th session.

After earning a bachelor’s degree in political science from Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria, Mr Barkindo went on to achieve a postgraduate diploma in petroleum economics and management from the College of Petroleum Studies at Oxford University and a master’s degree in business administration from Southeastern University in Washington, DC.

He is also a holder of an Honorable Doctorate Degree in Science from Modibbo Adama, Federal University of Technology, Yola, Nigeria. 

He is a fellow member of various international petroleum institutions such as the Institute of Petroleum, London.

2018-05-28,21106.925,Fireboxes Market to Witness Robust Expansion throughout the Forecast 2017 2025,"Fireboxes are available in various sizes as per the customers’ needs. A typical firebox consists of cast refractory panels, a fire grate or log pan and a fire screen. Cast refractory panels come in various sizes and designs and can be made of different materials, such as cement, bricks or metal. Prefabricated fireboxes come with metal panels. A fire grate or log pan is the chamber where fire is ignited using wooden logs or coal chips. It’s the most important component of a firebox. The fire screen separates the room from the fireplace, which ensures that no excess heat flows into the room, making the people inside uncomfortable. Fireboxes work on the principal of thermodynamics where the logs or other fueling agents, such as coal, are burnt in the fire grates. The heat thus produced is reflected by the refractory panels and the same is controlled using the fire screens.
 Fireboxes  come in a number of variants as per the standards set by the Chimney Safety Institute of America (CSIA) and American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) for a particular region and as per the house dimensions. Fireboxes can be classified into two categories, namely prefabricated and assembled. Prefabricated fireboxes are generally made of metal and come as a whole assembly while the other way is to get the parts separately, as per the need and aesthetic knowledge, and assemble them. Fireboxes are essential in keeping the room temperature normal in cold areas where the temperature dips below zero degree Celsius. Almost every house in North America, Russia, Europe and the other snowy areas has a firebox installed at the fireplace. Many people build a fireplace at home to aesthetically enhance their dining or living area. There can be more than one fireplace in a home; however, they are mostly installed in the hall. As the need for a firebox at home is never going to diminish, the market for the same is expected to fare well. At the same time, there is always room for improvisation in terms of the designs of the fireboxes, which can provide better looks, safety and efficiency.
Request Report Sample@     Fireboxes Market: Market Dynamics
The main drivers for the fireboxes market are the heavy replacements of worn-out fireboxes and the construction of new fireplaces at newly constructed buildings or at renovated houses and hotels. With the extensive use of steam turbines and superheaters in industrial applications, fireboxes are of immense importance in industries where superheated steam is used to produce electricity. Fireboxes are a mandate in cold regions as usage of electrical heating systems pronounces to be a costly affair when compared with the use of traditional heating systems. Although the newer technologies are more efficient, fireboxes can prove to be more reliable when constructed with better accuracy by taking into account the volume of room that needs to be satisfied with heat. As the construction of a fireplace at a house or hotel room gives an added aesthetic value to the place, this has emerged as a new trend in North America, Europe, Russia and other cold regions of the world. Many high class hotels in these regions provide fireplaces in suites, which helps them attract customers, while keeping the room warm and comfortable. The same trend has been observed with laymen who are keen on improving their homes aesthetically.
Although the market looks great for fireboxes, there are a few constraints that cannot be ignored. Firstly, the home where a new fireplace or firebox needs to be installed should fall under the considerations mentioned by CSIA and needs to maintain the building codes as quoted by ASME. Secondly, building a fireplace at home is oftentimes a costly affair and fireplaces need to be maintained on a regular basis. It is important for one to look for cracks and crevices in the refractory panels because if they are not maintained well, they can yield into carbon monoxide emissions, which can cause death. Plus, a badly maintained firebox can cause fire hazards. However, a properly maintained firebox is always healthy for homes. The market for fireboxes is expected to gain momentum in the coming years. As the cost of manufacturing is cheap, this market can provide a great opportunity for startups who can come up with advancements in the product line.

2018-05-29,21975.600000000002,Flow Batteries Market to Reflect Steady Growth Rate by 2017 2025,"Different types of flow batteries are available in the market, including redox, hybrid and membrane less. One of the major benefits of using flow batteries is their ability to get instantly recharged by changing the electrolyte liquid. The used electrolytes can be simultaneously returned to the storage tanks, which makes flow batteries more flexible than solid state batteries. As a result, they perform better during deeper discharge cycles, making them a viable option for long duration applications as compared to conventional batteries.
In the recent past, flow batteries have been gaining traction and are finding adoption in utility companies with large systems being deployed and planned for the coming years. Flow batteries are scalable as their capacity can be increased by using a higher amount of electrolyte in the tanks, which is making them perfectly suitable for utility-scale grid applications. Flow batteries offer a longer operational duration and expected life with low total cost of ownership as compared to conventional systems. As flow batteries are becoming less expensive than other storage alternatives, the deployment rate will further increase to cater new wind turbines and solar panels to maintain grid reliability.
Request Report Sample@    
Flow Batteries Market: Drivers and Restraints
New electricity generating capacity of local renewable energy producers, such as solar and wind, which experience fluctuating power output will generate the need for flow batteries’ storage systems as they provide frequency regulation and voltage support for utilities. Vanadium flow batteries hold a major share of the market. As a result, the market price of vanadium will be the determining factor for the success of flow batteries among other energy storage technologies. The flow batteries energy storage system requires a high grade electrolyte, which remains short in supply as current production methods are costly for manufacturers.
However, recent technical innovations are expected to reduce cost and address other industry needs and, in turn, are anticipated to drive the flow batteries market – making these batteries comparable with already established storage systems, such as lithium-ion batteries. The demand will increase substantially as electrolyte accounts for about one-third of the battery cost. Also, regional partnerships among key players will also play an important role in bringing production scalability and international reach in the flow batteries industry. Over the past few years, various flow battery makers have witnessed an increase in their sales revenue. The market players are entering into new supply chain agreements in an effort to create a vertically integrated supply chain model related to the sale, distribution and manufacturing of flow batteries.

2018-05-29,21975.600000000002,FOMO Factor: Powerless in Neustrelitz,"Avocado Johnson goes to that thing you're curious about to answer the question: Are you missing out? This time: Immergut Festival.


It felt like a bizarre social experiment. Take a few thousand Germans, bus them out to a field in the middle of nowhere and deprive them of internet, phone reception and finally electricity. What happens next?


The offer of a last-minute guest spot had persuaded me to finally check out Immergut, a long-running music festival in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern that caters almost exclusively to German indie fans with a lineup of old fogies (Tocotronic, Die Sterne and The Notwist have all played thrice), their modern-day successors (Gurr, Isolation Berlin) and a few out-of-town ringers – this year it was Ty Segall. If you’re looking to escape the Berlin English bubble for a weekend, this isn’t a bad place to do it. As long as the generator’s functioning, that is.


During a tent set by Berlin 1980s throwback Drangsal, the amps and mics suddenly cut off, leaving the drummer playing furiously for a few moments before he picked up on what was happening. Peering out of the tent, I realised the whole festival grounds had gone dark and silent, and seemed likely to stay that way for a while.


Mild-mannered indie kids, drunk festival bros and Neustrelitz locals who’d been offered discount tickets stumbled around not knowing what the hell was happening. Some of them retreated to their tents where, being Germans who pack for a two-day music festival an hour and a half outside Berlin as if they’re headed off for a month in the wilds of Siberia, they were perfectly prepared for just this scenario. Others loitered by the main stage until a guy came out with the world’s weakest megaphone and tried to shout an update, of which the only word anyone could understand was “Freibier!”


Yes, they’d decided to make all beer free until the new generator arrived. With mine in hand, I surveyed the situation and found it... weirdly comforting. This is the kind of situation that could lead to riots, looting and Mad Max-style roving scavenger societies. Instead, people were chilling out, talking, even singing. Despite the crushing demand for Freibier, the bartenders were in a good mood, pounding shots of Pfeffi in between pours. The worst thing that happened was a spontaneous a cappella cover of “Wonderwall” (admittedly, that’s pretty bad).


After two hours, they’d managed to restore power... but only to the “Birkenhain” stage, built for the festival’s smallest acts. Lo and behold, that’s where Ty Segall, who’s always game for this kind of thing, ended up playing an eardrum-shattering set to a massively grateful crowd. We’d skipped two acts, but nobody seemed that pissed off.


Why do we go to these festivals in the first place? Not for the chance to run around catching bits of incomplete sets from our favourite artists. Not for the drugs – well, not only for the drugs. No, I think it’s about the temporary sense of community, the feeling of bonding with these fellow Berliners who’ve made the trip to Neustrelitz and paid €60 to share the same experience. And this outage certainly strengthened that – as exemplified in the very first few minutes, when Drangsal (aka 24-year-old Max Gruber) jumped from the stage into the center of the crowd for a 100 percent acoustic singalong version of his hit “Turmbau zu Babel”.


“Alles in ordnung, denn ich lieb dich so, ich lieb dich so,” we chanted together as we sat on the wooden tent floor and used our smartphones as impromptu spotlights, and it truly did feel like everything was all right.


And then I got like three hours of sleep and woke up in a superheated tent that I suddenly became aware I’d built on a huge anthill, and I vowed never to go to a music festival again.

2018-05-31,18329.75,Record rainfall for Turin in May,"Spring rain showers in the north of Italy (especially in the pre-alpine zone) is to be expected, at least according to historical data that count May as the wettest month of the year. But the rainfall these last few weeks, particularly in the northwest, has been unprecedented. 

Turin is one of the cities to be hit by heavy, almost daily rain showers since April 29. Yesterday counted the 21st rainy day of May (today could well be the 22nd) — twice the historical average — thus setting a new record in the data series that started in 1803. Comparable rainfall has been recorded every 40-sum years: in May 1810, 1859, 1889, 1946, 1984, with episodes of 20-21 days of precipitation during the month. The reason lies in the anomalous position of the anticyclone. A Mediterranean summer with dry weather and new temperature records has already begun in Northern Europe, where temperatures of 29° C in Copenhagen and 32° C in Berlin were recorded. Meanwhile, Northern Italy remains at the mercy of moist but warm Atlantic currents. Still, more striking than the abundance is the persistence of local showers. 

  

A record amount of rainfall occurred in May 1810 with 564 mm of rain, when the Po flooded and the fields suffered “not only from a loss of the grains and fruits, but also by an overflow of rivers and torrents”, journals of the Turin Academy of Sciences recall. This year, apart from some more violent rainfall, it’s been fairly moderate and hasn’t caused too many problems on the territory (save for some difficulties in agricultural work and reduced electricity production from photovoltaic panels). With the exception of April, which was the most sunny and warm month in the last two centuries, we haven’t experienced such consistent rainfall since December.  

 

Unusual floods also hit Sardinia in early May with 200 mm of rainfall in just a few days. In recent weeks, Venice received a more fairly expected rainfall for the season, with 78 mm in 8 rainy days, and Palermo, 25 mm in 5 days. And although sun is expected throughout the weekend, starting Monday next week is punctuated with a new sequence of storms.

2018-05-31,18329.75,Superheaters Market To Hold a High Potential for Growth by 2017 2025,"These machines are found in the application of electricity generation using steam turbines and in the process of steam reforming where hydrocarbon fuels are burnt to obtain hydrogen, carbon monoxide and other useful products. Superheater is basically an assemblage of bent pipes called as superheater coils, firebox, exchange valves, flue gas exhaust and boiler/evaporator drum. The fuel is burnt in the firebox situated under the superheater coils. The steam from the boiler/evaporator drum is passed through the open valve into the superheater tubes, where the heat from firebox converts the wet steam into superheated/dry steam. This dry steam is them passed to turbines that spin to produce electricity.
 Superheaters  are available in various formats. The two main types of superheaters are radiant superheater and convection superheater. Radiant superheater is placed directly into the combustion chamber, while the convection type is placed in between the hot flue gases. Superheaters are necessary assets for power plants and for the applications, where high pressure dry steam is required to convert mechanical energy into electricity. There is no alternate products for superheaters in the market however, there are a few cases where the superheater tubes burst out due to high pressure or prolonged heating. There is a need for improvisation that can ascertain leaks and accidents during operation.
Request Report Sample@    
Superheaters Market: Dynamics
The prime driver for the superheater market is the boiler  power plants, where the application of superheated steam is of utmost importance. As the power generation has more than 60% share of the total sources of power generation in the world, the usage of superheaters is certainly high. The lifecycle of a typical superheater depends on its usage and varies from 6 years to more than 25 years. However, it is advised to have the superheater tubes inspected after every 100,000thoperational hour or after 6 years of installation, whichever is earlier. This calls to a descent replacement rate. The new trend seen in the superheaters market is encouragement from the government bodies to produce more energy units by establishing new plants. This is certainly going to benefit the market in the coming future.
The abovementioned factors have resulted into better establishment of superheaters market due to rising demand from the world’s most reliable energy production sectors. The end users are looking for better and more reliable superheating solutions, which can ensure better superheated steam and safety. Initial and maintenance cost of superheaters is a hindrance for the market. Although price is a constraint, providing enhanced quality and using sensors to detect leakage or fatigue can prove out to be an opportunity for the existing and new players. Yet, the other barrier is restriction from certain environmental bodies on burning of fossil fuels to generate electricity as it causes various forms of pollutions including air, water and soil pollution. Although the concerns are legible, the market is expected to sustain until a better alternative is introduced in the market.

2018-05-31,18329.75,ABB Ltd: ABB Technology Ventures invests in Indian food industry startup,"Group press release | Zurich, Switzerland, 31 May 2018
ABB Technology Ventures invests in Indian food industry startup
Strategic collaboration with ABB will streamline the dairy supply chain and drive operational efficiency for ABB's food  beverage customers
ABB has invested in Stellapps Technologies through its venture capital unit, ABB Technology Ventures (ATV). The Series B investment round was led by IndusAge Partners and included new investors Qualcomm Ventures and the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation (through its program-related investment team in London). Stellapps is India's first end-to-end dairy supply chain solutions company, in use by over 750,000 farmers daily. Founded in 2011, the Bangalore-based startup is building automated tools leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT) and advanced analytics to improve milk production and quality for the country's dairy farms, collection centers and processors. This is ATV's first investment in India.
The cornerstone of the Stellapps solution is SmartMoo, a full-featured analytics solution covering the entire value chain from milk production to farmer payments. SmartMoo can track an animal's health and yield through a wearable sensor, measuring parameters such as milk quantity and yield, and monitor conditions under which the milk is stored, transported and distributed.
India's $ 70 billion dairy market is one of the largest in the world by volume and the Stellapps effort is significant because it touches so many actors in the supply chain, including the broad base of rural dairy farmers. Most of these lower-volume farmers have previously lacked actionable data to improve their operations but through the Stellapps platform, free for their use, data regarding the quality and quantity of milk, the history of production by each farmer and the fees owed to them, enables immediate feedback and peer learning opportunities to improve productivity and boost income. Other needs in the Indian dairy industry such as improved inventory management, reducing deterioration of perishable food items, elimination of waiting times outside processing plants and better service delivery are also being addressed by the Stellapps platform.
In addition to the equity investment, Stellapps has separately initiated a strategic collaboration with ABB to create a digital offering for Indian customers to address these operational challenges. ABB is highly supportive of the work Stellapps is doing to responsibly add value to farmers large and small through education on animal care related to milk production.
""Since meeting Stellapps, we've been impressed with their category-defining software and the large market opportunity ahead of them,"" said Grant Allen, Managing Director at ABB Technology Ventures. ""We believe their technology will have a major impact on India's thriving dairy economy, especially the many dairy farmers running smaller, home-based operations. We've also worked closely with our control technologies business to complement ABB's existing offerings, notably our manufacturing execution system (MES) business, part of the ABB Ability Manufacturing Operations Management (MOM) offering. Cementing a partnership with Stellapps by becoming an equity investor enables ABB to go to market in India with a cloud-connected, IoT-led, digital dairy solution.""
Stellapps CEO Ranjith Mukundan said: ""Stellapps is entering a stage of accelerating growth, and this strategic group of investment partners will be very valuable to scale our technology platform. We are excited to partner with ABB Technology Ventures and tap into ABB's expertise and global reach for industrial automation solutions, particularly for food  beverage.""
ABB Technology Ventures, established by ABB in 2009, expanded its operations to India in 2016 with the objective of identifying and investing in game-changing technologies. ABB Technology Ventures currently has over 20 active portfolio companies and has invested nearly $200 million into startups spanning a range of sectors including robotics, drones, industrial IoT, AI/machine learning, cybersecurity, and grid automation.

Through the French Environment  Energy Management Agency (ADEME) the government plans to allocate €100 million next year to support the nation’s hydrogen industry. The so-called ‘plan Hydrogène’ aims to boost hydrogen deployment in industry, mobility and energy.

“Hydrogen can become one of the pillars of a carbon-neutral energy model,” Minister Hulot said. “This molecule, which contains a lot of energy, will become essential given the extent of its properties: it can store electricity, feed cars, recycle carbon dioxide (CO2) and make industrial processes cleaner.”

“France is at the forefront of this sector, and I want to give it the means to maintain its lead in the heart of an already fierce global competition because it is an asset for our energy independence but also a huge source of jobs. The H2 plan must be the impetus that will set in motion this sector of excellence to democratize, in the long term, the uses of this energy in our daily lives,” he added.

The plan includes the construction of 100 refueling stations (there are currently 20) and the deployment of 5,000 light commercial vehicles and 200 heavy duty vehicles (buses, trucks, and ships) powered by locally produced hydrogen by 2023. Moreover, the government expects to have 400-1,000 stations, 20,000-50,000 light commercial vehicles, and 800-2,000 heavy vehicles by 2028.

“There were three of us at home. My father left us and my mother had to pay her debts,” he told VTM.

“She earned €1300, working 10 hours a day. We’d eat the same things even three times a week and we could go a month without electricity.

“Going to Italy? I couldn’t not go. I wanted to go back after six months, but my brother convinced me to continue and stay.

“I earned €1400 a month at Pescara and was able to send €500 to my mother. My father? I went to Indonesia four years ago.

2018-06-06,21606.2,extending work in Aleppo,"Holding hands with two of her small children, Amal Mahmoud picks her way among puddles along an Aleppo street lined with the rubble of bombed houses.

Mahmoud, 43, was widowed by a rocket blast that killed her husband. Her work as a domestic helper does not provide enough money to feed the eight members of her family.

She is fighting to survive. “But my strength is weakening,” she says.

In Aleppo the bombardments and gunfire stopped in December 2016, but much of Syria’s largest city remains in ruins and more than two million people need humanitarian aid.

Nearly four years of fighting destroyed the once bustling historic city, bitterly dividing it into government and rebel-held halves.

The forces of President Bashar Assad ended the battle by capturing the rebel-held east in December 2016, but the devastation, human flight and division was so great that the city’s recovery has been painfully slow.

Syria’s civil war, now in its eighth year and one of the world’s worst ever humanitarian catastrophes, still rages in other parts of the country.

The United Nations estimates that 6.1 million people are internally displaced; 13.1 million are dependent on aid inside the country, with 5.6 million in acute need; and 5.5 million people have sought sanctuary in neighbouring countries.

Such is the horror and confusion of the war that it is impossible to estimate the number of people killed. Most international experts cite a general figure of over 500,000 deaths.

Peace has come to Aleppo and its conditions are improving, with supplies of water and electricity more frequent; but its requirements are urgent.

Some 2.25 million people need humanitarian aid. The city is hosting over 960,000 internally displaced people and eastern Aleppo remains in ruins. Many relief organisations and charities are leaving .

To help combat the crisis, Caritas is extending its work in the city by launching a three-year campaign.

“The ongoing crisis in Aleppo requires a more focused intervention to ensure the needs of the most vulnerable are met and that people are supported to build their livelihoods and sustain them,” said George Kahal, director of Caritas in Aleppo.

The Euro 4.1 million plan will help 34,300 people with assistance ranging from food and shelter to medicine and surgery.

Mehmoud and her family will be beneficiaries of the plan. In her bare, bomb-damaged house in east Aleppo, she says that Caritas is already helping, providing them with aid such as food, blankets and clothes.

“I’m exhausted, but happy that Caritas lightens my load,” she said. “Since I started receiving help, I know I’m not alone.”

Caritas’ work in the east and west of Aleppo has already reached more than 20,000 people with Euro 2.3 million dispensed in aid distributions, counselling and education, medical and rent support.

This includes the distribution of some 5,000 food vouchers; clothes sent to some 1,700 households; over 700 households receiving rental support; and health-related assistance given to 2,566 vulnerable people.

Non-food items handed out include kitchen kits, mattresses, battery-powered fans, solar-power lamps, water containers, carpets, detergents, and sanitary items. Caritas has given Aleppo’s children particular support.

Some 476 affected children are engaged in psychosocial support. They participate in activities that help them develop social skills, including hand washing, being respectful to each other and expressing feelings.

“At the end of each cycle we work to merge two different communities through an open day that brings together children and reunites groups of children in Aleppo,” said Kahal, director of Caritas in Aleppo.

Most of the children of Aleppo have lost years of study. Caritas provides extra classes to help bring pupils up to speed. Caritas also gives assistance to public and private schools and to university students.

Thanks to Caritas, more than 260 children have accessed tutoring and more than 280 received stationery supplies and school supplies.

Ibtisan, who lives in Aleppo, sends all five of her children to school. They all also attend a local Caritas centre that provides extra classes in English, Maths and Arabic.

“They all improved. They want to go to Caritas more than school,” said Ibtisan. “The most important thing I want them to do is keep learning.”

In Jabal Badro, one of the area’s worst affected by the violence in eastern Aleppo, Caritas is the only organization helping residents.

“Actually, we are not just helping with humanitarian aid, we are improving the lives of people there,” said Nawras Layous, Caritas project coordinator in Syria.

“When Caritas arrived in the eastern part of the city, the infrastructure was destroyed, water pipes were broken,” he added. “Caritas provided water tanks and water trucks that roamed the neighbourhoods filling houses’ water tanks.”

Abou Ahmed, a 53-year-old father of five from Jabal Badro, said the water supply and other Caritas assistance he receives has “lifted a burden from my shoulders”.

“I don’t have to worry anymore about buying water or medicines,” he said. “Caritas is taking care of that. Now I am focusing on my work as a porter to be able to earn some money for our livelihood.”

Caritas’ work to date and its new extended three-year plan to assist Aleppo cannot bring back the city to before the war, but it can help give its people a present.

“We are facing a challenge,” said Kahal, director of Caritas in Aleppo. “Many other NGOs and local charities are closing their activities in Aleppo. This will create a bigger burden on Caritas, but we are ready to face this challenge.”

Caritas works in major crises zones throughout Syria, including the capital Damascus and the city of Homs. It helped 230,000 people inside the country in 2017."
2018-06-06,21606.2,Environment Day: The World Must Unite to Beat Plastic Pollution,"The world must unite to “beat plastic pollution” United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said in his message for World Environment Day, noting that microplastic particles in the ocean, “now outnumber stars in our galaxy”.



In his message marking the day on 5 June, he said a healthy planet was essential for a prosperous and peaceful future, spelling out that: “We all have a role to play in protecting our only home.”



“Our world is swamped by harmful plastic waste,” he stated. “Every year, more than eight million tonnes end up in the oceans.”



Pointing out the astonishing comparison between stars in the cosmos and ocean plastics, Mr. Guterres underscored that “from remote islands, to the Artic, nowhere is untouched.”



If present trends continue, by 2050 our oceans will have more plastic than fish, he said.



On World Environment Day, Mr. Guterres is encouraging everyone to also stop using plastic products which are designed just to be thrown away, such as plastic bottles.



“Refuse what you can’t re-use,” he asserted.



“Together, we can chart a path to a cleaner, greener world,” concluded the Secretary-General.



Since it was first celebrated in 1974, the Day has helped raise awareness and generate political momentum around global environmental concerns such as ozone depletion, desertification and global warming.



The state of renewable energy



In conjunction with the Day, UN Environment (UNEP), on Monday, launched REN21, or the Renewables 2018 Global Status Report, which paints a positive picture of a renewable power sector characterized by falling costs, increased investment, record-setting installation and innovative business models that are driving rapid change.



The Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century, or REN21 – supported by UNEP - is a global renewable energy policy network that aims to facilitate knowledge exchange, policy development and joint action towards a rapid global transition to renewable energy.



After years of active policy support - driven by technology advances, rapid growth and dramatic cost reductions in solar and wind - renewable electricity is now less expensive than newly installed fossil and nuclear energy generation in many parts of the world.



But not all of the news is good. There is uneven progress between sectors and across different geographical regions, and a “fundamental disconnect” between commitments and real action on the ground.



The power sector on its own will not deliver the emissions reductions demanded by the Paris Climate Agreement or the aspirations of Sustainable Development Goal 7 to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all, says the report.



The heating, cooling and transport sectors, which together account for about 80 per cent of the world's total energy demand, are also lagging.



Simply put, the global renewable energy transition is progressing far too slowly."

2018-06-13,16699.225,Energy Revolution: Is the Energy-Storing Solar Cell Coming?,"Storing solar energy is a central challenge of the energy transition. One research approach is the conversion and storage of solar energy in a single molecule.

Electricity from renewable energy sources such as the sun or wind is only available when the wind blows and the sun shines. If little electricity is needed at this time, it is very difficult to store the remaining electricity. Scientists at the Friedrich Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg are working on new solutions and are focusing on chemical concepts for energy storage.

In two joint projects, the scientists are looking for new ideas for the molecular storage of solar energy. They are investigating molecules and processes that enable both efficient storage and controlled energy release. It is even conceivable that the stored chemical energy could be directly converted into electrical energy. This would enable the construction of an energy-storing solar cell.

The research is based on the so-called »norbornadiene quadricyclane storage system«. The substances norbornadiene (NBD) and quadricyclane (QC) are hydrocarbons and havebeen discussed by experts as potential candidates for the storage of solar energy for a long time: Under the influence of light, the molecule norbornadiene can transform into quadricyclane in a reaction within the molecule. This achieves an energy density equivalent to that of a high-performance battery. Because of this property, quadricyclane is also referred to as »solar fuel«.

In the sub-project »Photochemically and magnetochemically triggered storage / release of solar energy in strained organic compounds«, led by Prof. Dr. Dirk Guldi and Prof. Dr. Andreas Hirsch, the scientists are working on the production of various new families of NBD and QC derivatives.

In addition, they systematically investigate the influence of photosensitizers and electron acceptors as well as solvents and magnetic fields within this process. The long-term goal of the researchers is to realize a closed system fuel cycle for molecular storage media.

In the sub-project »Catalytic and electrochemical reproduction of solar energy stored in strained organic compounds« Prof. Dr. Julien Bachmann, Prof. Dr. Jörg Libuda and Dr. Christian Papp are developing new catalyst systems and electrodes with which chemical energy can be converted directly into electrical energy. They want to prove this functional principle conceptually by means of hybrid interfaces with suitable electronic structure, chemical structure, and electrochemical stability.

The results of the two subprojects, for which funding of more than 1 million euros from the German Research Foundation is available, could form the basis for the construction of an »energy-storing solar cell«."

2018-06-14,18053.125,Toyota plans further production and sales of fuel cell hydrogen vehicles | NGV Journal,"Toyota sees global sales of fuel cell vehicles increasing significantly after 2020, to at least 30,000 per year from today’s 3,000. To prepare for this growth, the company unveiled plans for two major new facilities today: a brand-new building near its original automobile factory for expanding fuel cell stack mass production, and a new line in an existing plant to manufacture high-pressure hydrogen tanks. The FC stack is what generates the on-board electricity from hydrogen and oxygen which propel vehicles with zero emissions, and the tanks store the hydrogen fuel. Manufacturing both components at scale is critical to achieving lower system costs and wider availability for further growth and sales of fuel cell vehicles.

To increase FC stack output, Toyota will move production from its current location, within one of the existing buildings at its Honsha Plant in Toyota City, to a brand-new, eight-floor high-tech facility on the same premises, near the original site of the company’s very first automobile factory in 1938.

The production of high-pressure hydrogen tanks will be handled by a new, dedicated line to be added inside the nearby Shimoyama Plant in Miyoshi City (Aichi Prefecture). Previously, the hydrogen tanks were assembled at the Honsha plant on a smaller scale. Toyota’s hydrogen tanks are made of extra-thick carbon fiber and are built to withstand major impacts.

The new facilities are expected to help significantly reduce CO emissions during the production stage. This is one of the initiatives for the Plant Zero CO Emissions Challenge in the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050 announced in October 2015. Construction of the new hydrogen tank line at Shimoyama is starting now, while the exterior for the new stack production facility is already finished and work will now begin on the interior. Details of the respective facilities will be announced later with a view to start operations around 2020.

As a technology, fuel cells are mature and ready to scale up. Toyota took the lead in bringing to market the mass-produced fuel cell sedan, the Mirai, in December 2014. Annual production and sales have increased yearly, going from about 700 units in 2015, to around 2,000 units in 2016, and, most recently, approximately 3,000 units in 2017. However, in order to encourage more widespread use of hydrogen-powered zero-emission vehicles, popularization needs to start by the 2020s. Toyota aims for annual sales of fuel cell vehicles to top 30,000 units globally from around that time. In the Japanese market, Toyota aims to reach sales of at least 1,000 units per month and over 10,000 units annually, from around 2020."

We can't come to the phone right now Imagine you’ve got a burglar in the house and you call the police (110 in Germany) for help. Well, this weekend it was revealed that nearly 500 unlucky callers are answered by automatic voicemail every day, because of a large amount of misuse. So if you're trying to make a petty complaint about your neighbor who kicked over your potted plant, remember you could encounter worse in the future – and actually may need it.

Killer balloon? Tuesday night, a helium, “I” shaped balloon floated up to the above ground rails between Alexanderplatz and Jannowitzbrücke and interrupted train service because of its – believe it or not – metal sheen. Although seemingly harmless, carrying those shiny, metal coated balloons is strictly forbidden in trains. Their coated exteriors can cause short-circuits and fires when they come too close to overhead electricity lines.

More money? Plans have been put in motion by Germany’s labour minister Hubertus Heil to review the minimum wage. He anticipates that the Minimum Wage Commission will propose a significant rise from the current €8.84 per hour. Service industry (and many other) workers, rejoice!

Bourdain in Berlin The first episode of ""Parts Unknown"" to air after the tragic death of Anthony Bourdain features the beloved chef and critic in Berlin. Bourdain’s remarks on Berlin? ""It's all here if you know where to look"". Missed the episode? Jane Silver gave the rundown.

¡Ay Chihuahua! A 35-year-old woman jumped into Landwehrkanal in an attempt to save her chihuahua. A bus driver discovered the woman at Zossener bridge at 1:55 and alerted the rescue service. After they arrived they pulled the woman to the shore and she climbed out safely via a ladder. Sadly, it was too late for the little dog.

Wild boars roam free In Tempelhof last weekend, two wild boars were spotted after drinking from a plastic, inflatable swimming pool in an apartment complex. Apparently these hot summer days are getting to them too. Afterwards, they were killed by the authorities. If you're thinking of giving the little guys water yourself, think again: A fee of up to €30,000 could come your way. The city enforces a strict policy against that due to the possibility of them spreading African swine flu.

Keep on roaming A Berlin family was charged €12 000 on their mobile bill after their son used 500 megabytes of data to watch videos while on a cruise ship from Kiel to Oslo. Yeah, roaming charges may be as good as gone inside the EU, but satellite-based mobile networks on cruise ships don’t apply. The family complained about the sky high bill which was then reduced to just under €5000, but they are still arguing the bill is too high. Our question, was there nothing for that kid to except watch Youtube?"
